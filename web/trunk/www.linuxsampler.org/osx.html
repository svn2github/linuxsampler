<a name="intro"></a>
<h3>1.&nbsp; Introduction</h3>

The LinuxSampler development team is delighted to announce the release of LinuxSampler-1.0.0 for Mac OS X.
LinuxSampler is an open-source disc-streaming software sampler that enables the expressive emulation
of instruments by the means of MIDI-triggered rendering of large sample sets. While the modular design 
of LinuxSampler allows for multi-engine and multi-format features, the present implementation of the Gig
engine already has the capability for producing virtual instruments with realistic emulations. VST (Linux, Windows)
and Audio Unit (OS X) plug-ins for digital audio workstations (DAWs) facilitate the use of this sampler within audio 
and MIDI sequencer applications. With its LinuxSampler Control Protocol (LSCP), LinuxSampler can be controlled over 
a computer network so that a cluster can be used as a gigantic sampler. Since this network protocol is ASCII-based, 
frontends for it can be written in any programming language and for any operating system. LinuxSampler itself is a server 
application that can be controlled by GUI frontends like the C++-based Qsampler and the Java-implemented Fantasia. The 
present release can be deployed on Linux, OS X and Windows. The instructions for using the OS X binaries are outlined here. 


<a name="requirements"></a>
<h3>2.&nbsp; Requirements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>PPC or Intel Mac
  <li>Mac OS X Leopard and Snow Leopard </li>
  <li> For the LinuxSampler(JACK) package: <A HREF="http://www.jackosx.com">JackOSX</A>. Install it before LinuxSampler(JACK)</li>
  <li><A HREF="http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/audio/midipatchbay.html">Pete Yandell's MIDI Patchbay</A> </li>
</ul>

<a name="installation"></a>
<h3>3.&nbsp; The LinuxSampler package</h3>
<ol>
  
  <li>Combined binaries of LinuxSampler and its derivatives for both Intel- and PowerPC-based Apple
  machines can be obtained by downloading the "LinuxSampler-1.0.0-OS_X.universal.dmg" disk image 
  from the <a href="http://www.linuxsampler.org/downloads.html">LinuxSampler
  Download Page</a>.
  </li>
  <br>
  <li> After mounting and extracting the contents of the disk image on your computer's desktop, 
  open the "linuxsampler-1.0.0" volume. The following choices are available:
  </li>
  <ol><ol>
  <br>
   <img src="screenshots/linuxsampler-1-0-0-dmg.png" border="0">
  </ol></ol></ol>
  <br>
  <li> This disk image contains two sets of universal binaries. The first set designated simply <i>LinuxSampler</i> is linked to
Apple's proprietary CoreAudio driver while the second <i>LinuxSampler(JACK)</i> folder contains binaries linked to the
third-party JACK (Jack Audio Connection Kit) audio server framework. In addition there is also the <i>LinuxSamplerAU.component</i>
Audio Unit plug-in which can be used within OS X-deployed DAWs for loading up virtual instruments.
  </li>
  <br>
The <i>LinuxSampler</i> folder contains the triple-architecture (ppc/i386/x86_64) universal binaries of "linuxsampler" and the 
"LinuxSamplerAU.component" DAW plug-in.
<br><br>
The <i>LinuxSamplerAU.component</i> plug-in should be dragged and dropped into the /Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/Components folder as 
shown by the rightward arrow. In a similar way, place the <i>LinuxSampler</i> folder into the /Applications folder 
  <ol><ol>
<h3>3.1.&nbsp; Loading a Virtual Instrument in your DAW</h3>
  <li> For a basic demonstration, we will load up the LinuxSamplerAU plug-in into GarageBand. First open the "Track Info" window: 
Track / Show track Info. Then in the Track Info window select "LinuxSampler Unit" from the "Generator" tab.
  </li>  
  <br>
  </ol></ol>
  <img src="screenshots/garageband-trackinfo.jpg"" border="0">
  <br><br>
  <li> A gig file can then be loaded using the "qsampler" or "Fantasia" application. Click on the "Add channel" icon
  in qsampler in order to load a gig file.
  </li>
<br>
<a href="http://download.linuxsampler.org/pix/screenshots/osx_qsampler_0_2_1.jpg">
 <img src="screenshots/qs_0_2_2_osx_1.jpg" border="0">
</a>
<br><br>
You are now ready to lay down your track...
<br><br>
(Note: JackOSX installation is NOT recommended in this setup since the Jack Audio Connection Kit hinders the initialization
of both <i>qsampler</i> and <i>Fantasia</i>.)
<br>
You may also read the <a href="jsampler/manual/html/jsampler.html">JSampler Manual</a> to find out how to configure LinuxSampler using <a href="screenshots/fantasia-osx.png">Fantasia</a>.
</ol></ol>
<h3>4.&nbsp; The LinuxSampler(JACK) package</h3>
</ol>
<li>
This archive contains dual-architecture ppc/i386 binaries of <i>linuxsampler</i> and "qsampler" which function together with
 <A HREF="http://www.jackosx.com">JackOSX</A>. This setup can be used for running various Jack-enabled applications simultaneously: a setup
 that is particularly useful for live situations.
 </li>
 <br>
 <li>
 After opening the linuxsampler-1.0.0 volume, place the <i>LinuxSampler(JACK)</i> folder into the /Applications directory as 
 indicated by the leftward arrow at the bottom.
 </li>
 <ol><ol>

<h3>4.1&nbsp; Setting up MIDI Input</h3>
In qsampler click on the "Device configuration" icon and then on Create.
<br><br>
</ol></ol>
<img src="screenshots/qs_midi_device.jpg" border="0">
<br><br>
If you need multiple MIDI input devices, set the "Number of ports" to 2, 3, ... before creating the MIDI device. The multiple ports will be accessible from other MIDI applications as "Linuxsampler_in_0", "Linuxsampler_in_1", etc.
<br>
<br>
(You should be able to create an arbitrary number of MIDI input devices by repeating "Create", but this feature does not work well yet.)
<ol><ol>
<a name="setup_audio"></a>
<h3>4.2&nbsp; Setting up Audio Output</h3>
Start the Jack audio server using JackPilot.app. The <i>qsampler</i> application can then be launched by double-clicking on its icon.
<br>
Load a gig file into qsampler by clicking on <i>Add Channel</i>. A dialog will appear. Select the GIG file you want to load, 
the instrument within the GIG file, the Audio device, the MIDI device and the MIDI port and channel.
<br><br>
<img src="screenshots/qs_0_2_2_osx_channel_setup.jpg" border="0">

<ol><br>

 Connect audio ports:
 In the "Connections Manager" pane of JackPilot: linuxsampler --> Built-in audio: in1 & in2
 or
 In the "Connections" window of qjackctl: LinuxSampler --> system<br>
 <br>
   <a href="http://download.linuxsampler.org/pix/screenshots/osx_qjackctl.jpg">
   
    <img src="screenshots/qjackctl-osx.jpg" border="0">
   </a>
   <br><br>Intel Mac Note: to use built-in audio in Jack, you need to create an "aggregated device" by using "Audio MIDI Setup". Please look up Jack manual for details.

 <br>

 <h3>4.3&nbsp; Configuring MIDI Input/Output</h3>
 Start MIDI Patchbay.app and connect your MIDI Input instance (probably your MIDI interface or USB-enabled keyboard) to  the "LinuxSampler_in_0"
 MIDI Output<br><br>
 </ol></ol>
   <a href="http://download.linuxsampler.org/pix/screenshots/osx_patchbay.jpg">
    <img src="screenshots/midi-patchbay-osx.jpg" border="0">
   </a>

<ol>

<a name="load_samples"></a>
<h3>4.4&nbsp; Loading Additional Samples</h3>
After loading additional gig files, the user can then save *.lscp files for convenient future use. 
In this way, the user can automatically set up audio and midi devices and 
load samples into the channel strips when recalling a setup.

<br>
Some bugs and problems we discovered so far:
<ul>
<li>The current LinuxSampler for Mac OS X binary distribution does not ship with gigedit yet.
While gigedit works using gtk with X11.app, the large number of dependencies
on external libraries makes it very arduous to prepare a universal binary.
</li>
  <li>Overloading the sampler (CPU overload or disk overload)
  produces noise.</li>
<li>  
  QSampler crashes when one tries to create a second port of jack. 
  An error dialog saying that "the device was not created" appears. After the dialog is dismissed qsampler crashes.
</li>
<li>
   Sometimes qsampler fails to quit gracefully; this calls for "Force Quit". After force quitting, the
linuxsampler subprocess is still running. In this case, simply invoke "killall linuxsampler" from Terminal.app to terminate
linuxsampler.
</li>

</ul>

			<h2>The Project</h2>
			<p class="default">
			The LinuxSampler project was founded with the
			goal to produce a free, streaming capable open source pure
			software audio sampler with professional grade features,
			comparable to both hardware and commercial Windows/Mac software
			samplers and to introduce new features not yet available by any
			other sampler in the world.
			</p>

			<h2>The Engine</h2>
			<p class="default">
			<u><b>LinuxSampler</b></u> was designed very modular, especially
			(and in contrast to other samplers) it was decoupled from any user
			interface. LinuxSampler itself usually runs as own process in the
			background of the computer and usually does not show up anything on
			the screen, or at most it can be launched to show status
			informations and debug messages in a console window:<br>
			<br>
			<a href="screenshots/ls_0_5_1_console.png">
				<img src="screenshots/ls_0_5_1_console_preview.png">
			</a><br>
			<br>
			That means LinuxSampler itself is the "engine" of the sampler, it
			is the software component which performs all the heavy and time
			critical computational tasks of handling MIDI events, calculating
			the audio data and sending the final audio data to your sound
			card(s). We call LinuxSampler the <i>sampler backend</i>.
			</p>

			<h2>The Face(s)</h2>
			<p class="default">
			Obviously you need some way to control the sampler. That's where a
			2nd application comes into game, which we call a
			<i>sampler frontend</i> application. A frontend is (usually) a
			graphical application, visible on the screen, providing the user
			a set of e.g. menus, buttons, sliders, dials, etc. to allow the
			user to control the sampler in a convenient way. It merely sends
			the user requests to the sampler engine (LinuxSampler) and in turn
			shows the engine's status informations on the screen. A frontend
			does not perform any signal processing tasks, so you can see it as
			a "face" of the sampler.<br>
			<br>
			For luxury we already provide you two different frontends / "faces"
			for LinuxSampler:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
				<u><b>QSampler</b></u> is a light-weight frontend written in
				C++, using straightforward native graphical controls of the
				underlying operating system. That way the appearance of
				QSampler on the screen is very fast and it only consumes very
				little resources. Due to its utilization of the operating
				system's common GUI controls, it looks slightly different on
				every operating system (also dependent of the user's selected
				theme on his OS):<br>
				<br>
				<a href="screenshots/qs_0_2_1_win.jpg">
					<img src="screenshots/qs_0_2_1_win_preview.jpg">
				</a>&nbsp;
				<a href="screenshots/qs_0_2_1_ubuntu.png">
					<img src="screenshots/qs_0_2_1_ubuntu_preview.png">
				</a><br>
				<br>
				Note however, QSampler does not fully support all features of
				the sampler engine (LinuxSampler) yet. Most notably the
				engine's instruments database feature is not yet covered by
				QSampler. But if you don't need that particular feature,
				you're certainly fine with QSampler as well.<br>
				<br>
				</li>

				<li>
				<u><b>JSampler</b></u> is a full-fledged frontend for
				LinuxSampler, written in Java and currently comes in two
				flavors: <b>JSampler "Classic"</b> offers straightforward GUI
				controls whereas <b>JSampler "Fantasia"</b> provides a modern
				skin based user interface:<br>
				<br>
				<a href="screenshots/fantasia.png"><img src="screenshots/fantasia-preview.png"></a>
				<br>
				JSampler supports all features currently available in the
				sampler engine (LinuxSampler). Also note that even though
				JSampler is written in Java and slightly more hungry
				regarding resources (compared to QSampler), this usually
				does not have any impact on the audio rendering performance
				of the sampler, since the engine runs completely independently
				and with much higher CPU priority than the frontend(s).<br>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="default">
			It's completely up to you which frontend to use. You could even use
			both parallel at the same time for the same sampler engine
			instance, really! ;-) You're concerned that your sampler frontend
			might waste precious resources of your computer? No problem, just
			setup the sampler session for your needs and then quit the
			frontend application. The sampler engine doesn't care! It continues
			to do its job. You need to change something? Start the frontend
			again (or another frontend) and you see what you expect to see: the
			current setup and state of the running sampler engine.
			</p>

			<h2>The Format</h2>
			<p class="default">
			It is planned to support all common sampler formats in
			LinuxSampler, but at the moment we chose to concentrate on the
			Gigasampler format, because when we started this project, the
			Gigasampler format was (in our opinion) the most popular
			and "best" sampler format in regards of quality and power,
			especially	for the synthesis of natural instruments like pianos,
			brass and bowed instruments. But we already made good advance in
			implementing this format, so we are optimistic to start with
			adding other formats soon. Beside that we also planned to
			design our own, sophisticated sampler format to introduce a more
			powerful and more flexible sampler format compared to
			any sampler format currently available in the world. Be encouraged
			to share your ideas about such a new format with us!
			</p>

			<h2>The Editor</h2>
			<p class="default">
			<u><b>gigedit</b></u> allows you to edit and create instruments
			for the Gigasampler format, which can be used with LinuxSampler
			as well as with Tascam's Gigastudio. Following our line of
			modularity we also made the instrument editors independent
			applications. Because let's face it: every sampler format is
			different, so in our opinion it is better to honor the specific
			features of one format with its own instrument editor application
			instead of trying to fiddle everything into one single bloated
			application. So gigedit is our first editor, dedicated to the .gig
			format:<br>
			<br>
			<a href="screenshots/gigedit_0_0_3.png"><img src="screenshots/gigedit_0_0_3_preview.jpg"></a>
			<br>
			You can use gigedit as stand-alone application or in conjunction
			with LinuxSampler. For the latter case gigedit installs a plugin
			into the sampler engine, so the engine (and with it the frontends)
			knows that gigedit actually exists and can handle the .gig format.
			So even though we decoupled the sampler's components into
			independent applications, they all work seamlessly together.
			<a href="http://download.linuxsampler.org/doc/gigedit/quickstart/gigedit_quickstart.html#live_editing">
				Just press the "Edit" button
			</a> on a channel strip of a frontend and
			gigedit will automatically popup on the screen and you're
			immediately ready to edit your selected instrument, making all your
			modifications audible in realtime. Even when editing huge
			instruments of 1GB or more, tweak the instrument with gigedit and
			immediately hear it while playing on the keyboard at the same time.
			And the good thing: even with new sampler formats we're going to
			add soon (and with it new editors), you don't have to remember
			which instrument you loaded uses which format. Simply click on
			"Edit" in a frontend and the sampler engine will choose the right
			instrument editor application for the respective instrument for
			you.
			</p>

			<h2>The Technical Interface</h2>
			<p class="default">
			As the components of the sampler are independent applications,
			there must be a way to let the applications communicate with each
			other. For this LinuxSampler provides a native C++
			<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface">API</a>
			as well as a network interface using an ASCII based protocol which
			we call "<a href="http://www.linuxsampler.org/api/draft-linuxsampler-protocol.html" title="LinuxSampler Control Protocol">LSCP</a>"
			for controlling the sampler engine and managing sampler sessions.
			Our frontends support that network interface, which also allows to
			control the sampler engine with the GUI frontend(s) remotely from
			another computer, probably even running a completely different
			Operating System. And compared to other remote control solutions,
			the frontend won't feel sluggish, as the frontend is running on
			your local machine.<br>
			<br>
			You can also configure your computer to automatically start the
			sampler engine and loading your prefered sampler session without
			any frontend, simply by using a <i>LSCP session file</i>. How do
			you get such a "LSCP session file"? Both frontends write LSCP
			session files for you when you request them to save your current
			sampler session. And as those LSCP session files are ordinary
			human readable text files, you can adjust them with any text
			editor if you want.
			</p>

			<h2>The Compatibility</h2>
			<p class="default">
			LinuxSampler is available for the most popular operating
			systems and already supports a variety of audio and MIDI driver
			systems on each OS. It does not require any special dedicated
			device drivers from the sound card manufacturers, so you can
			also use it with cheap consumer cards. Due to its clean design
			the sampler can be ported to other operating systems and
			extended for further driver systems with a minimum of effort.
			So we're prepared for the future!
			</p>

			<h2>The Community</h2>
			<p class="default">
			You need a helping hand? You certainly get the answers on your
			personal questions on our
			<a href="http://bb.linuxsampler.org/">web forum</a>.<br>
			<br>
			All applications are under active development. However we all work
			on this project for fun in our spare time. There are still so many
			things to do and our hands are limited. So don't hesitate on
			participating to the project! You don't necessarily need to be a
			skilled programmer to help the project. Testing the applications,
			<a href="http://bugs.linuxsampler.org.">reporting bugs</a>, writing
			documentation, providing artwork, themes for frontends, etc. helps
			us and all users a lot! Simply subscribe to our
			<a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/linuxsampler-devel">
				developers mailing list
			</a> and we'll of course take you by the hand in case you want to
			participate with active source code development. Don't be afraid!
			You have your own ideas and concepts for making the sampler better?
			Great, share them with us!<br>

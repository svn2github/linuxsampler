<h2>LinuxSampler for Windows&nbsp; - howto by Benno Senoner&nbsp; </h2>
<br>
December,&nbsp; 7 2007<br>
<br>
the LinuxSampler development team is happy to announce that<br>
LinuxSampler, the most advanced free, open source sampler now runs on
MS Windows too (requires at least Windows 2000).<br>
(see below for the download link)<br>
More information and documentation will be added here soon, so check
back frequently.<br>
<br>
for the latest LinuxSampler Windowsversion always check <a

If you have questions or want to help subscribe to the <a

mailing list</a><br>
<br>
or since I did most of of the porting, you can write me directly (to
Benno) about&nbsp; Windows related questions.<br>

<br>
<br>
For now it supports Windows Multimedia System (MME) at MIDI in and ASIO
output out.<br>
<br>
This means that currently it runs only as a standalone application.<br>
A VST interface will follow soon, along with a network module to run
multiple sampler slaves on<br>
Windows or Linux machines (Linux provides better performance) all
controlled from a Windows box running <br>
the VST sequencer.<br>
LinuxSampler is implemented as a client/server application. This means
the sampling engine (the server) runs<br>
independently from the GUI (the client). Sampling engine and client can
be run on the same box or<br>
on different machines too, connected over the network.<br>
<br>
The MS Windows version provides all the features of the Linux version
since it is built from the <br>
same source code base. This means when new features will come out the
Windows version will always provide<br>
the same feature set as the Linux version. This was made possible by
the very modular design of both<br>
low level, operating system functions and flexible audio/MIDI driver
system.<br>
<br>
The Windows version comes as a self extracting .exe file which will
install all the necessary modules<br>
to run both the server ( linuxsampler.exe ) and the GUI client.<br>
In installs 2 GUI clients. One is QSampler, based on the cross-platform
Qt4 GUI toolkit, and a java<br>
GUI client called JSampler Fantasia. At the moment the latter more
advanced than qsampler as it <br>
implements all the functionality present in the LinuxSampler engine.<br>
Due to the Java virtual machine it uses a bit more memory than the
qsampler GUI (around 30MB or so)<br>
but on a 1GB+ RAM box the difference should be negligible.<br>
<br>
Quickstart:<br>
start<br>
LinuxSampler -&gt; LinuxSampler<br>
then<br>
LinuxSampler -&gt; Fantasa<br>
<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<big style="font-weight: bold;">1) setting up MIDI input</big><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">:</span><br>
once the GUI opens, click on the left round button in the MIDI devices
tab.<br>
At this point a window will open where you can create a new MIDI device.<br>
Press Create. The window will close and the MIDI device will be created.<br>
(MIDI Device 0 MME).<br>
Now click on the right arrow which points downwards.<br>
You can see that a MIDI device with a single Port (Port 0) was created.<br>
Under Windows MME LinuxSampler always creates MIDI devices which are
connected to a single <br>
MME port.<br>
To select the MIDI input port you must click on the field located on
the left of PORT. <br>
A combobox pops-up where you can select the Windows MIDI port.<br>
<br>
You can create an arbitrary number of MIDI input devices by repeating
the procedure above.<br>
Each MIDI input device is connected to a single Windows MME MIDI port.<br>
This means LinuxSampler has no limitation in terms of number of MIDI
ports. <br>
Each MIDI device can be routed to arbitrary sampler channels.<br>
<br>
<br>
<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">2) setting up AUDIO output:</span></big><br>
<br>
LinuxSampler currently uses the ASIO driver model for audio output.<br>
ASIO drivers ensure reliable low-latency operation and are virtually
available<br>
for any soundcard.<br>
(For consumer audio cards which do not come with their own ASIO drivers
you need<br>
to install ASIO4ALL:&nbsp; http://www.asio4all.com/<br>
We recommend to use version 2.7 , perhaps on Vista 2.8beta1 works
better but<br>
we did not perform tests on Vista so we cannot tell it. Let us know
about your findings<br>
so we can share them here)<br>
<br>
Click on the left round button in the Audio Devices tab.<br>
At this point a window will open where you can create a new MIDI device.<br>
When creating the Audio device you can set several parameters.<br>
- CARD : the name of the soundcard, in case you have multiple cards
installed.<br>
it will show the default value (first card found)<br>
- CHANNELS: number of audio output channels, can range from 1 to
maximum number<br>
of channels your soundcard supports. We recommend to leave the default
value which<br>
is maximum number of channels.<br>
- FRAGMENTSIZE: ASIO buffer size in samples. The card's default value
is shown.<br>
If you experience clicks and pops during audio playback then initialize
the <br>
audio output device with bigger values. <br>
(better if it's always a power of 2:&nbsp; eg. 256, 512, 1024)<br>
<br>
SAMPLERATE: sets the samplerate. The default value is shown.<br>
<br>
Now Press Create. The window will close and the Audio device will be
created.<br>
AUDIO DEVICE 0 (ASIO)<br>
<big style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
3) Loading samples:</big><br>
<br>
In the middle of the screen below the volume slider you see the sampler
channel strip pane.<br>
press on the round button located on the left. <br>
This will create a new sampler channel.<br>
- click on Load Instrument <br>
this opens a dialog which allows you to select an instrument to be
loaded in the sampler channel.<br>
For now ignore the upper part (Select instrument form orchestra) as
this feature is not implemented<br>
on Windows yet.<br>
On the row&nbsp; "Select instrument from file" click on the orange icon
located on the right side.<br>
This opens a file dialog which allows you to select a sample to be
loaded <br>
(currently only the GIG format is supported).<br>
select the sample to be loaded and then click on Open.<br>
At this point the fields Instrument file shows the filename.<br>
You can click on the Instrument index and select the specific
instrument contained in the<br>
instrument file.<br>
Now press OK<br>
While it loads you see: Loading .. 90% .. 100% <br>
Once loaded you see the Instrument's name: ie&nbsp; FreePiano<br>
<br>
On the left side of the sampler channel click on the arrow below
Options.<br>
This pane permits to set MIDI input device, port and channel and oudio
output channel.<br>
Notice that under Windows MME the Port value is always 0.<br>
So the only values you can change MIDI device (normally 0 if you
created only a single<br>
MIDI input device) and the MIDI channel (from 1 to 16).<br>
<br>
Saving a sampler session:<br>
click on the 3rd icon from the left on the row where you see the round
icon with the S logo.<br>
<br>
Now select the directory where you want to save the file to ( extension
.lscp = Linux Sampler Control Protocol).<br>
enter the name and press save. (add .lscp at end of file otherwise you
will not see it when loading it)<br>
<br>
Next time you can load a sampler session by clicking on the second icon
from the left <br>
then select a .lscp file in the file dialog and press Open.<br>
This will automatically set up the MIDI devices and audio devices,
create the sampler channels<br>
and load all the samples that were loaded.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Bugs and Problems: <br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small></span>since the
Windows port is very young there could be several bugs which we hope to
root out soon.<br>
so be sure to report them using our bug tracking system <a
 href="http://bugs.linuxsampler.org/">http://bugs.linuxsampler.org/</a><br>
<br>
some bugs and problems I discovered:<br>
- when adding a channel there noises could occur while playing on other
channels<br>
- if you overload the sampler (CPU overload or disk overload) it
produces noises<br>
- then editing an instrument using gigedit<br>
<br>

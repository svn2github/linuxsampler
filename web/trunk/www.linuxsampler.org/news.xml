    Major services (CVS, downloads, Bug Tracking System) were down in the last
    days due to a hardware defect on one of our servers. CVS is finally up
    again and we are working on restoring all other services in the next days
    as well. We are also establishing further backup facilities to prevent this
    happening again. Sorry for any inconvenience!

    Due to a design change, current LinuxSampler CVS version is quite unstable.
    You might want to use the previous, stable version of LS in the meantime,
    which can be downloaded as
    <link ref="http://www.linuxsampler.org/downloads.html">source tarball
    </link>. Alternatively you can also checkout the old version from CVS which
    was tagged as "v0_2_0".

    We are currently in a transition stage due to the recent changes (multi
    channel / multi engine / multi audio output device and multi MIDI input
    device support) this also leads to multi problems we have to solve ;-) so
    meanwhile you can use the old single channel version. We created the two
    CVS alias tags 'singlechannel' and 'v0_1_0' which you can use to checkout
    the old single channel version of LinuxSampler. The CVS command line is the
    same except that you have to add '-r singlechannel'.

    Lots of news for the Linuxsampler community. We've got a new site, new
    domain and new code available in CVS. Check the
    <link ref="http://www.linuxsampler.org/downloads.html">downloads</link>
    section for instructions. If you want to check it out, please keep in mind
    that it might contain bugs, it might crash and that it's still lacking tons
    of features. CVS is directed towards developers who would like to test
    things and add code. Users should wait for a tarball release.

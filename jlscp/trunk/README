Requirements
============

To use jlscp you need java version 1.5.0 or higher.

To build the library, the documentation or the examples you need
JDK version 1.5.0 or higher and the Ant tool (http://ant.apache.org/).


Compilation
===========

Notice that the package contains both the source and the binary files.
So you can skip this section unless you want to rebuild the library or
you are using version downloaded from cvs.
 
To build the library, examples or documentation follow the next steps.

  1. Set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to point to your JDK directory.
     If the JDK is installed in /opt/jdk1.5.0 directory, this can be done
     with the following command:

     export JAVA_HOME=/opt/jdk1.5.0

     (Windows users must do something like `set JAVA_HOME=c:\jdk1.5.0')

  2. Choose one or more of the following options.

     - Building the library (jlscp.jar): `ant build-lib'

     - Building the documentation: `ant build-doc'

     - Building the examples: `ant build-examples'

     - Building all (library, examples, documentation): `ant build-all'

     Also you may specify more then one target: `ant build-lib build-examples'


Installation
============

To install jlscp as an extension just copy jlscp.jar in the following directory:

<JDK-home>/jre/lib/ext

If you don't want to install jlscp as an extension, you may use the following
option when compiling or running an application that depends on it:

-cp .:/path/to/jlscp/jlscp.jar


Documentation
=============

The documentation is located in the doc directory. Also you can look at the
examples directory.


Running examples
================

To run the examples `cd' to examples/build directory
and use one of the following commands:

java -cp /path/to/jlscp/jlscp.jar:. Poll
java -cp /path/to/jlscp/jlscp.jar:. Events
java -cp /path/to/jlscp/jlscp.jar:. CreateChannel

Notice that on Windows platforms class path entries are separated by
semicolons (;) instead of colons (:).

Thanks for using jlscp.

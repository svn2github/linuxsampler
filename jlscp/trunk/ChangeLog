      getFileInstrumentInfo,  getFileInstruments
    - MidiInputDevice: added new methods - getPortsParameter,
      setPortsParameter

jlscp v0.6a: 2007-10-15
  * Added support for escape sequences

  * API Changes
    - Client: added new methods - editChannelInstrument, formatInstrumentsDb
    - Client: getAudioOutputDriverInfo is now public and accepts a
      dependences list of parameters
    - Client: getMidiInputDriverInfo is now public and accepts a
      dependences list of parameters

  * Bug fixes:
    - Parameters with unset values are now not sent to LinuxSampler

jlscp v0.5a: 2007-05-24

    stream or to the standard output stream (java.lang.System.out) if
    no output stream is specified, without taking any further actions.

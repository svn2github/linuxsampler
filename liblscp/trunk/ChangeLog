liblscp - LinuxSampler Control Protocol API
-------------------------------------------

ChangeLog

0.3.1  2005-07-21  [bug #21] Fixed automake support for separate build
                   directory.

0.3.0  2005-06-10  [bug #11] Timeout flush idiosyncrasy is now a feature;
                   this just tries to flush the receive buffer whenever
                   any previous transaction has failed due to a timeout.

                   Fixed an off-by-one timeout quirk, that has been a real
                   showstopper on Mac OS X at least, which is incidental
                   to qsampler's default timeout setting of 1000 msecs,
                   giving up systematically on select() due to "Invalid
                   argument" (EINVAL).

0.2.8  2005-05-22  More LSCP command syntax changes, particularly on the
                   event subscription ones: the LSCP_EVENT_CHANNELS event
                   definition were renamed to LSCP_EVENT_CHANNEL_COUNT,
                   as to be more meaningful. Added support for the newest
                   LSCP command: GET SERVER INFO; lscp_get_server_info().

0.2.8  2005-05-08  [bug #9] Fixed for a LSCP command syntax convention 
                   consistency, regarding the enumeration of available 
                   sampler engines, Audio and MIDI drivers; this has 
                   affected the signature of the following functions:
                     lscp_get_available_engines();
                     lscp_get_available_audio_drivers();
                     lscp_get_available_midi_drivers();
                   which are now returning an integer count of engines
                   and drivers, respectively, while the following 
                   functions are now being introduced:
                     lscp_list_available_engines();
                     lscp_list_available_audio_drivers();
                     lscp_list_available_midi_drivers();
                   taking on the previous functionality, returning
                   a comma separated list of names.

0.2.7  2005-03-10  Mini bitsy regression; a severe crash (segfault)
                   was fixed on the device configuration functions:
                     lscp_set_audio_device_param();
                     lscp_set_midi_device_param();
                     lscp_set_audio_channel_param();
                     lscp_set_midi_port_param();

0.2.6  2005-03-01  Fixed nasty off-by-one bug on internal helpers.

0.2.5  2005-02-14  Added support for the new INSTRUMENT_NAME field
                   of GET CHANNEL INFO command.

0.2.4  2004-10-11  Fixed lscp_set_channel_midi_channel() again, MIDI
                   channels should be given in the range 0-15, and omni
                   mode with the LSCP_MIDI_CHANNEL_ALL symbol (16).

                   Fixed lscp_get_channel_info() to parse MIDI omni
                   (ALL) channels mode.

0.2.3  2004-09-28  Fixed lscp_set_channel_midi_channel() where MIDI
                   channels should be given in the range 1-16, and
                   omni mode with the new LSCP_MIDI_CHANNEL_ALL
                   symbol (0).

                   Rearrangement on main command requester executive.

0.2.2  2004-07-29  In sync with LSCP document draf (v.12).

                   New functions added: lscp_client_get_events() and
                   lscp_reset_sampler().

                   Added support for generating Debian packages;
                   renamed pkg-config lib name 'liblscp' -> 'lscp' as
                   it's common practice to omit the 'lib' prefix.

0.2.1  2004-07-09  Potential cripling defects habve been fixed.

0.2.0  2004-07-06  New LSCP extension draft (v.11) initial support.
                   (still a work in progress...)

0.1.9  2004-05-18  More fixes for MSVC++ example build.

0.1.8  2004-05-17  Fix for MSVC++ example build; snprintf replaced by
                   buffer overflow friendlier sprintf.

0.1.7  2004-05-10  Missing version.h now included on install; WIN32 is
                   only now conditionally defined.

0.1.6  2004-05-04  WIN32 build support; LPGL disclaimer consistency;
                   versioning functions introduced.

0.1.5  2004-04-26  Server stuff moved into examples.

0.1.4  2004-04-24  Initial auto/libtool preparation.

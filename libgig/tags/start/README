  libgig actually consists of three parts:

  - RIFF classes (RIFF.h, RIFF.cpp): Provides convenient methods to parse and
                                     access arbitrary RIFF files.
  - DLS classes (DLS.h, DLS.cpp):    They're using the RIFF classes to parse
                                     DLS (Downloadable Sounds) Level 1 and 2
                                     files and provide abstract access to the
                                     data.
  - gig classes (gig.h, gig.cpp):    These are based on the DLS classes and
                                     provide the neccessary extensions for
                                     the Gigasampler file format.

Requirements
============
  I simply used automake & co this time so you will need to have automake,
  autoconf and libtool installed. I used the following versions:

    automake  1.6.3
    autoconf  2.57

  If you want to compile the 'gigextract' application that comes with these
  sources then you will additionally need to have libaudiofile installed (I
  used version 0.2.3).

Non-POSIX systems
=================
  If you don't have a POSIX system, you have to set 'POSIX' to '0' in RIFF.h.
  Instead of using POSIX calls then standard C calls will be used for file
  access.

Compiling:
==========
 - Use 'CXXFLAGS=-pedantic ./configure && make all' to compile the library
   and all tools and demo applications.

 - Beside the actual library there are four applications:

     gigdump:     Demo app that prints out the content of a .gig file.
     gigextract:  Extracts samples from a .gig file.
     dlsdump:     Demo app that prints out the content of a DLS file.
     rifftree:    Tool that prints out the RIFF tree of an arbitrary RIFF
                  file.

 - If you have Doxygen installed you can generate the API documentation by
   just running 'doxygen' in the sources' top level directory.

 - 'make distclean' to clean up everything again

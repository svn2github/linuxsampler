Portability:
  - finish endian dependent macros and structures
  - test library on non intel machines

DLS Part:
  - support for conditional chunks
  - check for ZSTR terminated strings in DLS::Info::LoadString()

Gig Part:
  - support for <3dnl> chunk in gig::Region class which provides optional
    textual descriptions for dimensions
  - support for <3gnm> chunk in gig::File class which contains names of
    sample groups
  - additional scan for compressed samples in
    gig::Sample::ScanCompressedSample() to build a table with the compression
    mode of each compressed frame in the sample allowing a more efficient
    Read() on runtime
  - low level optimization in decompression algorithm
  - optional writing of frame table to disk to speed up loading of compressed
    samples

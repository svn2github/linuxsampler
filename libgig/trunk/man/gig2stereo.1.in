.SH NAME
gig2stereo \- Converts Gigasampler (.gig) files from mono pairs to true stereo.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gig2stereo
[-v] [--verbose [LEVEL]] [-r] [--keep] [--force-replace] FILE_OR_DIR1 [ FILE_OR_DIR2 ... ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Takes a list of Gigasampler (.gig) files and / or directories as argument(s) and
converts the individual Gigasampler files from two separate mono sample pairs to
true stereo interleaved format. Given directories are scanned for .gig files.
The Gigasampler files are directly modified, not copied. Since at this point the
Gigasampler format only defines mono and stereo samples, this program currently
also assumes all samples in the .gig files provided to be either mono or stereo.

Background: The Gigasampler/GigaStudio format allows to create stereo
instruments in two ways: either by referencing true stereo (interleaved) samples
in the instruments, or by referencing a pair of (two) mono samples. Unfortunately
LinuxSampler does not support the latter at the moment, thus if a gig instrument
uses mono sample pairs, you will still hear it in mono. This tool was created to
circumvent this issue by allowing to convert gig files to using real stereo
(interlaved) samples instead. And even if LinuxSampler would add support for
mono sample pairs, it would be less efficient than using real stereo samples,
both concerning disk streaming as well as DSP processing after streaming input.

After conversion, you will find all newly created true stereo samples in
separate new sample group(s), which will be postfixed with " STEREO" in their
group names. So you should easily be able to distinguish the newly created true
stereo samples (i.e. when editing the .gig file with
.BR gigedit (1)
) from old samples. Also, if the original (now replaced) mono samples were
postfixed with a channel indicator in their sample names
(i.e. "Spiccato D3 -L"), the new stereo samples will have a similar sample name,
but without such an audio channel indicator at the end of their names. Thus in
the mentioned example, the newly created stereo sample would be named
"Spiccato D3" instead.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \ FILE_OR_DIR1
Gigasampler (.gig) filename or directory
.TP
.B \ FILE_OR_DIR2
Gigasampler (.gig) filename or directory
.TP
.B \ --force-replace
Force replacing any found old mono sample reference by the new true stereo
samples. By default certain references of the old mono samples are not replaced
by new true stereo samples, usually because the respective old mono reference is
been used in an instrument context that seems to be entirely a mono use case,
not stereo, and thus replacing the mono sample reference by stereo ones might
not be intended for the respective instrument. Because there might indeed be
instruments in the same .gig file which are designed as explicit mono variant
(i.e. to allow the musician to save resources while playing, or for live
mix-down reasons, which are usually mono on live venues). By using
--force-replace all those old mono sample references in question will also be
replaced by the new stereo sample references.
.TP
.B \ --keep
Keep old mono samples. By default old converted mono samples, if they are not
referenced by any instrument anymore, will automatically be deleted after
conversion. By using this argument it will preserve all of the old mono samples.
.TP
.B \ -r
Recurse through subdirectories.
.TP
.B \ -v
Print version and exit.
.TP
.B \ --verbose [LEVEL]
Be verbose and print additional informations while converting. The additional
numeric argument is optional, it allows to define the verbosity level
(1 .. 2, default: 1).

Version ? (?)

  libgig's home has moved (slightly) from
  http://stud.fh-heilbronn.de/~cschoene/projects/libgig/ to
  http://stud.hs-heilbronn.de/~cschoene/projects/libgig/, please update your
  links and bookmarks! This is due to the recent renaming of the University
  of Heilbronn, which kindly hosts this and other projects.

Version 3.0.0 (28 Apr 2006)

  This is the first release which allows to create new and modify existing
  .gig files. Beside that it also includes another bunch of bug fixes and
  Gigasampler v3 support improvements.

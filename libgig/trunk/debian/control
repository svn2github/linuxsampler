Description: library for accessing Gigasampler, DLS, SoundFont, KORG, AKAI files
 libgig is a C++ library for reading, modifying and creating Gigasampler /
 GigaStudio (.gig) files, DLS (Downloadable Sounds) Level 1/2 files, SoundFont
 version 2 (.sf2) and KORG sound files (.KMP and .KSF). These files are
 typically used in modern day audio waveform samplers and synthesizer keyboards.
 .
 Since the Gigasampler / GigaStudio and DLS formats are based ontop of the
 binary RIFF container format, this library also provides convenient access to
 RIFF files in general.
 .
 This package also contains a Linux/POSIX ported version of libakai, which
 provides support for reading Akai formated medias (CDRoms, HDs, Zip disks).
 Currently Akai S1000, S01, S2000 and S3000 series are supported.

Description: command line tools for Gigasampler, SF2, DLS, KORG and AKAI files
 Raw file handling for audio sampler files based on either DLS Level 1/2,
 Gigasampler / GigaStudio, SoundFont version 2 and KORG sound format (.KSF and
 .KMP). These files are typically used in modern day audio waveform samplers
 and synthesizer keyboards.
 .
 There are also tools for reading Akai formated medias (CDRoms, HDs, Zip disks).
 Currently Akai S1000, S01, S2000 and S3000 series are supported.
 .
 This package contains the following command line tools:
 .
 gigdump:
   Prints out the content of a .gig file.
 gigextract:
   Extracts audio samples from a .gig file.
 gigmerge:
   Combines multiple .gig files to one .gig file.
 gig2mono:
   Converts .gig files from stereo to mono.
 dlsdump:
   Prints out the content of a DLS file.
 rifftree:
   Prints out the RIFF tree of an arbitrary RIFF container file.
 sf2dump:
   Prints out the content of a .sf2 file.
 korgdump:
   Prints out the content of KORG sound files (.KSF, .KMP).
 korg2gig:
   Converts KORG (.KSF, .KMP) sound files to GigaStudio (.gig) files.
 akaidump:
   Dump an AKAI media i.e. from a CDROM drive as disk image file to your HD.
 akaiextract:
   Extracts audio samples from an AKAI media or from an AKAI disk image file.

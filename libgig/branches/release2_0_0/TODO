DLS Part:
  - support for conditional chunks
  - check for ZSTR terminated strings in DLS::Info::LoadString()
  - real support for 64 bit offsets (used by Gigasampler v3 files)

Gig Part:
  - Write support? Please let me know if you are interested to write an
    instrument editor based on libgig. I'm not going to add write support
    to libgig until somebody tells me his intention to seriously write such
    a tool!
  - support for <3dnl> chunk in gig::Region class which provides optional
    textual descriptions for dimensions
  - support for <3gnm> chunk in gig::File class which contains names of
    sample groups
  - additional scan for compressed samples in
    gig::Sample::ScanCompressedSample() to build a table with the compression
    mode of each compressed frame in the sample allowing a more efficient
    Read() on runtime
  - low level optimization in decompression algorithm
  - optional writing of frame table to disk to speed up loading of compressed
    samples
  - real support for 24 bit samples (introduced by Gigasampler v3 format)
  - support for additional articulation informations introduced by the
    Gigasampler v3 format

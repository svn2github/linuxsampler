Qsampler - A LinuxSampler Qt GUI Interface
------------------------------------------

Qsampler is a LinuxSampler GUI front-end application written in C++ around
the Qt3 toolkit using Qt Designer. At the moment it just wraps as a client
reference interface for the LinuxSampler Control Protocol (LSCP).

LinuxSampler is a work in progress. The goal is to produce a free, open source
pure software audio sampler with professional grade features, comparable to
both hardware and commercial Windows/Mac software samplers.

The initial platform will be Linux because it is one of the most promising
open source multimedia operating systems. Thanks to various kernel patches
and the Jack Audio Connection Kit, Linux is currently able to deliver rock
solid sub-5 millisecond MIDI-to-Audio response.

Installation
------------

The installation procedure follows the standard for source distributions.
Unpack the tarball and in the extracted source directory:

    ./configure [--prefix=/usr/local]
    make

and optionally as root:

    make install

This procedure will end installing the following couple of files:

    ${prefix}/bin/qsampler
    ${prefix}/share/icons/qsampler.png

Just launch ${prefix}/bin/qsampler and you're off (hopefully).

Note that the default installation path ${prefix} is /usr/local.


Configuration
-------------

Qsampler holds its settings and configuration state per user, in a file
located as $HOME/.qt/qsamplerrc. Normally, there's no need to edit this file,
as it is recreated and rewritten everytime qsampler is run.

Bugs
----

Plenty still, after all this is early alpha software ;)


Support
-------

Qsampler is open source free software. For bug reports, feature requests,
discussion forums, mailling lists, or any other matter related to the
development of this piece of software, please use the Sourceforge
project page (http://sourceforge.net/projects/qsampler).



Enjoy.

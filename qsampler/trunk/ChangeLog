qsampler - A LinuxSampler Qt GUI Interface
------------------------------------------

ChangeLog

0.1.0   2005-03-15  Device configuration work in progress...

* Device configuration interface preparations.


0.0.5   2005-03-04  Fifth alpha-release.

* Fixed device driver type channel information gathering,
  which was severely flawed, dropping all channel session
  configurations to the default audio driver type (which
  is ALSA) unexpectedly.

* Channels are now properly renumbered when saving to a
  session LSCP script, assuming that it should be always
  loaded from scratch (i.e. zero channels).

* Disabled MIDI port setting on channel dialog, and on
  session file save, as its use is still troublesome.

* Added new menu and toolbar option: Reset All Channels.

* Channel setup changes are now properly filtered, as for
  only those settings that are actually changed gets applied;
  change information are now also posted to messages window.

* Drag-and-drop of either session files (LSCP scripts) or
  instrument files (GIG) are now supported. Multiple files
  drop is allowed, but it only makes sense for instrument
  files, each one prompting to create a new sampler channel.

* Drag-and-drop to an existing channel strip is now also 
  featured, allowing the in-place change of the channel 
  sampler instrument file.

* Actual instrument names are now optionally retrieved
  from the instrument file, even though libgig is available,
  avoiding excessively annoying load times while on the
  channel dialog, when huge instrument files are selected.

* Set to ignore the SIGPIPE ("Broken pipe") signal, where
  available, as the default handler is usually fatal when
  a JACK client is zombified abruptly.

* Messages window limit is now enforced only when the line
  count exceeds in one third the user configured line count
  maximum; if Qt 3.2.0+ is in use, the QTextView widget is
  otherwise set to the optimized Qt::LogText format.


0.0.4   2004-11-19  Fourth alpha-release.

* Instrument index selection now made via combo box widget;
  actual instrument names are now properly retrieved from
  the instrument file, provided if libgig is available.

* Sampler channels strips are just created if, and only if,
  the respective channel setup dialog is actually accepted,
  following common user-interface guidelines.

* Almost complete rewrite of sampler channel strips internal
  control structures.

* Sampler reset command action added to menu and toolbar.

* MIDI channel selection is now a dropdown list, allowing
  the explicit selection for "All" channels input per sampler
  channel (omni mode).

* Channel strip display glass effect has changed background
  color to black (was green), being now an user option.

* Minor configure fixes.


0.0.3   2004-07-06  Third alpha-release.

* Mon-modal intrument file loading and status support.

* Effective MIDI input port setting on channel dialog,
  and on session file save.

* Channel dialog gets sensible engine and driver defaults
  on create time.

* Implied channel reset on successful instrument load.


0.0.2   2004-06-15  Pre-revolutionary release.

* The channel context menu is also accessible by right-clicking
  over the empty workspace area.

* Added small wait event loop on qsamplerMainForm::stopServer(),
  so let local server terminate gracefully and stabilize, and
  avoiding a probable segfault on exit, which was preventing the
  correct salvage of settings and configuration.

* Maximum channel volume percent setting is now a global option,
  provided to override the default (which is 100%).

* Client/server transaction timeout option upper limit has been
  increased from 5000 to 60000 milliseconds.

* A channel context menu is now featured, by right-clicking over
  each sampler channel strip.

* Commented SET CHANNEL MIDI_INPUT_PORT command from
  qsamplerMainForm::saveSessionFile(), it has no effect.

* Insert a n #include <unistd.h> on qsamplerMessages.cpp, between
  a #if !defined(WIN32) clause.

* An initial non zero value (0.8) is now set for volume of every
  new sampler channel strip.

* The order to load/save and setup channel settings is now as
  suggested in the following lines:

    SET CHANNEL AUDIO_OUTPUT_TYPE ...
    SET CHANNEL MIDI_INPUT_TYPE ...
    SET CHANNEL MIDI_INPUT_CHANNEL ...
    LOAD ENGINE ...
    LOAD INSTRUMENT ...
    SET CHANNEL VOLUME ...


0.0.1   2004-06-05  Primordial alpha release.

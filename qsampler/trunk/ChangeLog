qsampler - A LinuxSampler Qt GUI Interface
------------------------------------------

ChangeLog

0.0.2   2004-06-08  Work in progress...

* A channel context menu is now featured, by right-clicking over
  each sampler channel strip.

* Commented SET CHANNEL MIDI_INPUT_PORT command from
  qsamplerMainForm::saveSessionFile(), it has no effect.

* Insert a n #include <unistd.h> on qsamplerMessages.cpp, between
  a #if !defined(WIN32) clause.

* An initial non zero value (0.8) is now set for volume of every
  new sampler channel strip.

* The order to load/save and setup channel settings is now as
  suggested in the following lines:

    SET CHANNEL AUDIO_OUTPUT_TYPE ...
    SET CHANNEL MIDI_INPUT_TYPE ...
    SET CHANNEL MIDI_INPUT_CHANNEL ...
    LOAD ENGINE ...
    LOAD INSTRUMENT ...
    SET CHANNEL VOLUME ...


0.0.1   2004-06-05  Primordial alpha release.

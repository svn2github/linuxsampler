Qsampler - A LinuxSampler Qt GUI Interface
------------------------------------------

TODOs

- Complete coverage of the LinuxSampler Control Protocol:
  - Support for FX Sends
  - Allowing to create more than the two standard MIDI instrument maps
    ("Chromatic" / "Drumkits").
  - Instruments DB support.
- Any feature one can think of ;)

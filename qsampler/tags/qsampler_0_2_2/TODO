Qsampler - A LinuxSampler Qt GUI Interface
------------------------------------------

TODOs

- Complete coverage of the LinuxSampler Control Protocol:
  - Support for FX Sends
  - Allowing to create more than the two standard MIDI instrument maps
    ("Chromatic" / "Drumkits").
  - Instruments DB support.
  - Support for handling sampler events (see chapter 5.2
    "Subscribe/notify communication method" of the LSCP specs).
  - Support for handling "multiplicity" type parameters in the device
    management dialog (i.e. for parameter "ALSA_SEQ_BINDINGS" of LS's ALSA
    MIDI driver, allowing to make arbitrary amount of MIDI connections). At
    the moment one can only set a scalar value for these parameter types.
- Any feature one can think of ;)

      The command line application <i caption="LinuxSampler Control Protocol">lscp</i>
      is a text based shell for controlling the sampler entirely from the
      command line, providing colored output, type completion, help text while
      typing LSCP commands and other convenient features for terminal
      enthusiasts who want to use the sampler without any

    <h3>Visual Feedback</h3>
    <p>
      As you can see on the screen shot above, the LSCP shell displays all
      possibilities to complete the current command in real-time while you are
      typing. In contrast to other shells you don't need to
      hit a special key over and over again for that. These hints are always
      automatically displayed right next to your text cursor (in yellow color).
      Also the color of your current command line changes while you are typing:
      <ol>
        <li><b>White:</b>
          As long as the current command line is incomplete, it will be
          displayed in white color.
        </li>
        <li><span style="color:red;"><b>Red:</b></span>
          You accidently hit the wrong key? The shell will automatically mark
          mistyped characters in red color, that is only the part of your
          command line which is wrong. So you immediately see that your command
          line is wrong before even hitting the return key and you also see
          which characters you have to delete with backspace to correct the
          current command line.
        </li>
        <li><span style="color:green;"><b>Green:</b></span>
          As soon as your current command line is complete and correct, the
          line will change to green color, so you immediately see that you may
          now trigger the return key.
        </li>
      </ol>
      There is even more: as soon as the shell detects which LSCP command you
      are going to fire, which may be long before you actually complete the
      current command line, the shell will automatically display a detailed
      description for that LSCP command, taken from the LSCP specification
      document. These text sections are automatically grabbed from the LSCP
      specification document at compile time and built into the shell. So there
      is no special document directory structure or even an Internet connection
      required for that feature.
    </p>
    <p>
      So these visual feedback features reduce the amount of times you have to
      grab for the LSCP specification document, and provide a huge speed up of
      your LSCP typing tasks.
    </p>

    <h3>Type Completion</h3>
    <p>
      As with other shells, you may hit the tab key to auto complete your current
      command line. However in contrast to other shells this feature is not
      limited to a small set of keywords, this feature is directly combined with
      the real LSCP parser module, and thus it completes your command line as
      much as possible, which may include a sequence of several keywords, and
      may also stop at a certain character within a keyword. In other words: it
      auto completes as much characters until a position is reached where a
      human decision is required.
    </p>

    <h3>Automatic Correction of trivial Errors</h3>
    <p>
      There are days when things must go fast, when you may even not have the
      time to care about the visual feedback features described above. On such
      days it happens that you fire commands with the shell that may have typos
      and other mistakes. The LSCP shell will help you and automatically
      corrects trivial mistakes for you. So after you fired a command with the
      return key, the command line will be checked, and if it is incorrect, the
      shell will check your command line for trivial mistakes, automatically
      correct those errors for you, display the updated, corrected command line
      in the shell and execute it with the sampler. Or do you want to get
      bothered for things like upper/lower case or space/underscore confusions?
    </p>

    <h3>Always up to date</h3>
    <p>
      You may think that those mentioned automation features may only work for
      a certain part of the LSCP protocol, or that they may lag behind new LSCP
      extensions or changes. Fortunately this never the case! As with modern
      development environments, the LSCP shell is directly connected with the
      sampler's real LSCP parser module. That means whenever there are any
      changes to either the LSCP protocol (i.e. keywords and grammar rules) or
      to the LSCP specification document, they will automatically also be
      available to the LSCP shell. So it does not require any further
      development effort to maintain the shell and keep track of the latest
      LSCP features. And since the LSCP shell is designed as thin client, you
      may even use an old version of the LSCP shell on your local machine and
      use it to control a remote computer with a more recent LinuxSampler (and
      LSCP) version, without missing any of the latest LSCP changes with the
      shell's automation features.

    <h2>What next?</h2>
    <p>
      If you have never been in touch with LSCP before, you might have a look
      at the latest
      <a href="http://www.linuxsampler.org/api/draft-linuxsampler-protocol.html">LSCP specification document</a>
      first.

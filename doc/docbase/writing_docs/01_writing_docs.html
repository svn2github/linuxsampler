    <p>
      This article provides a short introduction about how to write documents
      for this site. We appreciate any volunteers trying to help us writing
      documentation for LinuxSampler and friends.
    </p>

    <h3>At a Glance</h3>
    <p>
      There are plenty of documentation systems out there. Why did we need yet
      another one? Most of those systems require you to learn some kind of custom,
      exotic markup language to write documents with them. Then there are
      <i title="<u><b>W</b>hat <b>Y</b>ou <b>S</b>ee <b>I</b>s <b>W</b>hat <b>Y</b>ou <b>G</b>et:</u> A system that immediately shows you the result while creating content.">
      WYSIWG  
      </i> systems which require to maintain user accounts for people who want to
      add or change content and are suffering under periodic security issues,
      which in turn require frequent software updates to avoid the site getting
      compromised. And last but not least; they don't deliver everything you
      need and are often hard to extend or to be customized.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="new_article.png" style="height:112px; margin-right:15px;">
      This site is using one of the best, most flexible, and well known markup
      languages as basis for writing documents:
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a>. But obviously there
      are some caveats to use HTML as-is. Most notably it requires you to write 
      a lot of monothonic, superfluous things again and again just to achieve
      simple things. And on the other hand it requires authors to invest a
      substantial amount of time learning the numerous required aspects of HTML
      and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets">CSS</a>.
      Fortunately; you don't have to. You don't need to have any precognition
      of HTML or CSS to write articles for this site.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here are some of the features of our documentation system in overview:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Articles are created as plain and extremely simple HTML files, which
          do not neccessarily require any previous knowledge in HTML
          (or even CSS) by article authors.
        </li>
        <li>
          The article's HTML file can immediately be previewed on the author's
          local computer by just opening it with a browser. No upload or web
          application required while creating or editing articles.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once the article is ready, it can be submitted to our server, which
          will then be filled up automatically by our software to generate our
          documentation site. The software performs all redundant work that is
          usually required to build websites with regular HTML files. This
          automatic generation supports the following features:
          <ol>
            <li>
              Automatic generation of the site's article structure. The site's
              structure can very easily be changed, by just moving around the 
              article source HTML files in the article source repository. No single
              article needs to be edited for any site structure changes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Automatic correction of links and image references in articles,
              i.e. on site structure changes, trivial input errors or file type
              changes. No user interventation required.
            </li>
            <li>
              Automatic syntax highlighting of source code snippets in articles,
              so the author can concentrate simply on the content and correctness
              of his source code snippets. The software
              generates the correct look of your source code examples for you.
            </li>
            <li>
              Automatic generation of site's navigation bar, article's table of
              contents and article section IDs for the entire website.
            </li>
            <li>
              Automated generation of tooltips for links to other articles and
              technical terms or abbreviations.
            </li>
            <li>
              Automatic detection of fundamental errors in articles. Our system
              tries to correct any kind of issues automatically as much and as far
              as possible, in order to avoid bothering article authors with any kind of trivial
              things. However there are cases where it simply cannot resolve
              issues with individual articles on its own, even not by "guessing".
              In this case it will notify the author(s) about the precise problem,
              so they are aware about it and asks them to do the manual correction.
            </li>
            <li>
              This site's software is written in native C++, it generates and
              updates the entire site extremely fast. And since it is only
              updating the site's files when some input article changed, it can
              also be run as unpriviliged user and/or in a sandbox environment.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          The site's template is a regular, static HTML file. So you can edit and
          test the site's overall look with a regular browser. No need to comment
          in/out things just for changing the general look of the site.
        </li>
        <li>
          Extensible: all articles are still real HTML after all. So you can
          easily add any kind of HTML, CSS and Java Script on your own for
          individual articles of yours if really required. So it is not neccessarily
          required to change our site's software just to add some kind of customization
          for some of your articles.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Enough said, let's dive in and actually see how to create an article.
    </p>

    <h2>A Base Article</h2>
    <p>
      Creating a new article for this site is as simple as creating a new text
      file and adding following text:
    </p>
    <code l="html">
<h1>My First Article</h1>
<p>
  This is the first paragraph.
</p>
    </code>
    <p>
      This would already be sufficient to be a valid document and all the rest
      would  automatically be added by our site's software for you. It is
      recommended though to start new documents always with following template
      instead:
    </p>
    <code>
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title>??article-title??&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;meta name="author" content="??author-name??"&gt;
    &lt;meta name="description" content="??short-description??"&gt;
    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="http://doc.linuxsampler.org/css/preview.css"&gt;
    &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="http://doc.linuxsampler.org/js/preview.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    <h1>??article-headline??</h1>
    <p>
      This is the first paragraph.
    </p>
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
    </code>
    <p>
      Add this to an empty text file and rename the file to a HTML file with
      arbitrary name like <code>my_first_article.html</code>.
      That template above has the advantage that you can simply open that file
      locally on your machine with your web browser and immediately preview how
      the article will look like on our website while you are writing the
      article. So you don't need to upload it somewhere for that purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don't worry, you don't need to understand everything that's there. All you
      need to know is described next.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Article Short Description</h3>
    <p>
      You may provide a short description of your article with
      <code>??short-description??</code>. This is completely optional. It is used
      for example when your article is linked from another article. In that
      case the reader may i.e. move the mouse pointer over the link and a tooltip
      will popup with the document's title and the short description as summary
      of what that article is about.
    </p>

    <h3>Article Title</h3>
    <p>
      With <code>??article-title??</code> you provide the title of the article,
      which will be displayed in the browser's window title bar and it will also
      be displayed on our site's horizontal navigation bar, which you can find
      at the top of each page. It will also be used by our site to auto generate
      a directory structure for the generated website, thus it also has an
      impact on the final <i>URL</i> of your article.
    </p>
    <p>
      With <code>??article-headline??</code> you define the prominent headline
      shown at the very beginning of the article.
    </p>
    <p>
      In most cases <code>??article-title??</code> and
      <code>??article-headline??</code> will probably be the same text for one
      article. In that case you may also omit either one of the two. The
      software will then automatically add the missing headline or title for
      you.
    </p>
    <p>
      In some few cases you may want to have more control over the aspects of
      the article's title, its final URL path and what shall be displayed in
      the navigation bar. In this case you may use some additional optional tags
      in your document's head like this:
    </p>
    <code>
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title>??article-title??&lt;/title&gt; <!-- article's title -->
    
    &lt;urlpath>??article-path??&lt;/urlpath&gt; <!-- article's directory (in URL path) -->
    
    &lt;navpath>??nav-bar-name??&lt;/navpath&gt; <!-- article's name in navigation bar -->

    &lt;meta name="author" content="John Smith"&gt;
    &lt;meta name="description" content="This is my first article."&gt;
    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="http://doc.linuxsampler.org/css/preview.css"&gt;
    &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="http://doc.linuxsampler.org/js/preview.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    <h1>??article-headline??</h1>
    <p>
      This is the first paragraph.
    </p>
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
    </code>
    <p>
      In this case, <code>??article-title??</code> is now only used for displaying the
      article's name in the browser's title bar and in case the reader
      bookmarks your article with his browser.
      <code>??article-path??</code> is the directory
      name where the final, generated article shall be place at. Accordingly
      this also changes the final URL to the article. And last but not least,
      <code>??nav-bar-name??</code> defines the name of your article as it shall
      be displayed on the site's navigation bar. As said, these additional tags
      are completely optional. In most cases you should be fine by just providing
      a <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> and/or <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> with your
      article.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Article Authors</h3>
    <p>
      Also completely optional is providing <code>??author-name??</code> as 
      name(s) of the person(s) who wrote the article. If you provide that information,
      then the name will be displayed in the footer section of the article on
      our site. Don't be shy and add your name to get credited for your work.
      If you change an already existing article, you may simply add your name
      by adding a comma like so:
    </p>
    <code>
&lt;meta name="author" content="John Doe, Bob Fox, Mary Smith"&gt;
    </code>
    <p>
      The author information may also be useful for people to contact the person
      who wrote the original article in order to ask some questions about it.
    </p>

    <h2>Headlines</h2>
    <p>
      All headlines in your article are defined with regular HTML headline
      tags. The following three headline types are available:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li><code><h1>??article-headline??</h1></code> Like described in the
          previous section, a <code><h1></code> headline is the most prominent
          headline of your article. It should only be used once; at the very
          beginning of your article to display the general topic of the article.
      </li>
      <li><code><h2>??sub-headline??</h2></code> This headline type is a bit
          less prominent than a <code><h1></code> headline. You may use 
          <code><h2></code> headlines to introduce important sections
          of your article.
      </li>
      <li><code><h3>??sub-sub-headline??</h3></code> This is the least
          prominent headline type. You may use it to further subdivide your
          article in smaller sections.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      This is the corresponding look for each one of the three headline types:
    </p>
    <example>
      <h1>This is a &lt;h1&gt; headline</h1>
      <h2>This is a &lt;h2&gt; headline</h2>
      <h3>This is a &lt;h3&gt; headline</h3>
    </example>
    <p>
      It's completely up to you which one of those three headline types to use,
      how often you use them and where. All of them will be taken by the site's
      software to automatically generate a table of content of your Article,
      which will be shown at the left side next to your article on our site.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once your article is uploaded to our site, IDs for the individual
      headlines will automatically be generated for you. If for example you had
      somewhere in your article a headline called "Conclusion of Topic", then
      this particular paragraph of your article may be directly linked to from
      other articles or other sites with an URL like
      <code>http://doc.linuxsampler.org/path/to/your/article/#conclusion_of_topic</code>.
      If you want to override this behavior, because you rather want to use your
      own ID for a paragraph of your article, then simply set the desired ID with
      your headline:
    </p>
    <code>
<h3 id="my_conclusion">Conclusion of topic</h3>
    </code>
    
    <h2>Paragraphs</h2>
    <p>
      You should wrap each continous text block of your article in between
      a paragraph tag pair like:
    </p>
    <code>
<p>
  This is a paragraph. All the text in a paragraph is combined to one continous
  text block. You may add as much text as you want to a paragraph of your article,
  but better separate you article into logical parts of separate paragraphs. So to start a
  new paragraph, wrap the next text block into a new pair of paragraph tags.
</p>
<p>
  This is the next paragraph. There will be an empty line between this paragraph and
  the previous and next paragraph, to separate paragraphs visually from each other.
</p>
    </code>
    <p>
      Which would look like:
    </p>
    <example>
      <p>
        This is a paragraph. All the text in a paragraph is combined to one continous
        text block. You may add as much text as you want to a paragraph of your article,
        but better separate you article into logical parts of separate paragraphs. So to start a
        new paragraph, wrap the next text block into a new pair of paragraph tags.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is the next paragraph. There will be an empty line between this paragraph and
        the previous and next paragraph, to separate paragraphs visually from each other.
      </p>
    </example>
    <p>
      Wrapping paragraphs into <code><p>??text??</p></code> blocks not only causes
      trivial new lines in between them. This construct also allows you to easily
      define whether certain additional content like images and source code
      examples shall be shown directly embedded within the text block or shall
      rather be shown separately outside of text blocks, like described next.
    </p>

    <h2>Pictures</h2>
    <p>
      To display i.e. screen shots, figures and other kinds of images in your
      article, simply place the picture file in the directory where your
      current article's file is located at. Then add the image to your article
      with an <code><img src="some_picture.png"></code> HTML tag. There are two
      distinct ways to do that, like described below.
    </p>
    <h3>Stand-Alone Pictures</h3>
    <p>
      To place a picture on
      its own between two text paragraphs, simply place the <code><img></code>
      tag between the two paragraphs in your HTML file:
    </p>
    <code>
<p>
  This is the first paragraph. Just before the picture.
</p>

<img src="some_picture.png" caption="??footnote??" title="??tooltip-text??">

<p>
  This is the next paragraph, just after the picture.
</p>
    </code>
    <p>
      The optional <code>??footnote??</code> adds a footnote text just below the
      image and the optional <code>??tooltip-text??</code> defines a text which
      will popup if the reader points his mouse over the image. The previous
      example would look like this:
    </p>
    <example>
      <p>
        This is the first paragraph. Just before the picture.
      </p>
      <img src="a_picture.png" caption="Some Explanation" title="A tooltip text">
      <p>
        This is the next paragraph, just after the picture.
      </p>
    </example>
    <p>
      You also don't have to care about the size of the image. If the image
      resolution is largen than the width of the article would currently require
      on the user's screen, then the image will automatically be downscaled to
      fit the width of the article. It is recommended though to keep the width
      of images approximately below 1200px, just to not waste too much repository space
      (that is disk space) and network bandwidth.
    </p>

    <h3>Embedded Pictures</h3>
    <p>
      Sometimes however it looks nicer to have a picture embedded directly inside a
      paragraph of text and let that text float around that picture, especially
      when using rather small images. To achieve that, simply place the image
      tag inside the paragraph of your HTML file like:
    </p>
    <code>
<p>
  <img src="some_picture.png">
  This is some text of a paragraph. In this particular case, this text will
  float around the picture. The rest of this text is just repeating,
  repeating, repeating, repeating, repeating, repeating, repeating,
  repeating, repeating, repeating, repeating, repeating, repeating,
  repeating, repeating, repeating, repeating, repeating, repeating,
  repeating, repeating, repeating, repeating, repeating, repeating,
  repeating, repeating, repeating, repeating, repeating, repeating,
  repeating, repeating, repeating, repeating, repeating, repeating,
  repeating, repeating, repeating, repeating, repeating, repeating,
  repeating, repeating, repeating, repeating, repeating, repeating,
  repeating, repeating, repeating, repeating, repeating, repeating.
</p>
    </code>
    <p>
      Which would look like this:
    </p>
    <example  style="clear:both;">
      <p>
        <img src="a_picture.png">
        This is some text of a paragraph. In this particular case, this text will
        float around the picture. The rest of this text is just repeating,
        repeating, repeating, repeating, repeating, repeating, repeating,
        repeating, repeating, repeating, repeating, repeating, repeating,
        repeating, repeating, repeating, repeating, repeating, repeating,
        repeating, repeating, repeating, repeating, repeating, repeating,
        repeating, repeating, repeating, repeating, repeating, repeating, 
        repeating, repeating, repeating, repeating, repeating, repeating, 
        repeating, repeating, repeating, repeating, repeating, repeating, 
        repeating, repeating, repeating, repeating, repeating, repeating, 
        repeating, repeating, repeating, repeating, repeating, repeating.
      </p>
    </example>
    <p>
      As you can see, no special knowledge in i.e. HTML or CSS required to achieve
      such things very easily.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Unique Pictures</h3>
    <p>
      Once your article and its picture(s) are uploaded to our server, our
      system will automatically check that all images on our entire site have
      unique and unambiguous file names, no matter at which directory they
      are stored to exactly. The "file name" that is checked in this case, is
      actually the picture's file name without its file type extension
      (i.e. without ".png", ".jpg", ".gif", etc. at its end). There are two reasons for this:
      <ol>
        <li><b>Site Structure Changes:</b>
          After a while, the structure on a website changes. Certain articles
          are moved to completely different directories and some article's may
          reference pictures that were already added and used by other articles before.
          Which makes sense of course, why saving the exact same picture 10 times
          under different image files if you can just reference that already existing image file from your new article?
          Now when those articles and/or the images move to different locations,
          the image references within such articles might turn to dead references.
          Our system automatically detects this and corrects the references in
          articles to any kind of image file automatically, without requiring
          any user intervention. So we can change the structure of the website
          at any time without having to update any article file.
        </li>
        <li><b>File Type Changes:</b>
          Sometimes it happens that a picture needs to be replaced with a
          picture in a different file format. For example the original picture
          was added in .jpeg format to have a very small file size, but later on
          some kind of transparency is required for the picture, which is not
          supported by JPEG. In this case the picture would i.e. be updated
          and replaced with a .png image file. Our system also detects this and
          automatically updates all references to that image file in all articles
          to the precise new name of the image file. Again, no user intervention
          required.
        </li>
      </ol>
      But for the system to be able to that automatically, it requires all
      image files to have unique file names, like described above. If you try
      to upload a new image file to our system which uses a file name that was 
      already taken by another image, then you will automatically be notified by
      our system via email, asking you to rename one of the image files.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Source Code</h2>
    <p>
      You might need to post example source code in some of your articles. This
      is very simple to do. Just wrap your source code into a pair of
      <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> tags like this:
    </p>
    <code>
&lt;code&gt;

  ??source-code??
  
&lt;/code&gt;
    </code>
    <p>
      Syntax highlighting is automatically generated for you, according to the
      programming language or markup language used by you. That way you don't
      have to waste time on how to display source code nicely, and rather
      concentrate on the content of your article. Like with images, you can
      decide in which context the source code shall appear in your article,
      as described next.
    </p>

    <note>
      Automatic syntax highlighting is currently available for the
      <ul>
        <li><a href="nksp.html">NKSP real-time instrument script language</a></li>
        <li>HTML markup language</li>
      </ul>
      If you need another source code language, just tell
      <a href="http://www.linuxsampler.org/developers.html#Schoenebeck">Christian</a>
      and he will add the required module for any kind of language
      (even the most exotic one) on our server in short time.
    </note>

    <h3>Stand-Alone Code</h3>
    <p>
      If you put your code block outside of paragraphs, that is between
      paragraph blocks in your HTML file, then the source code will also appear
      on its own between the paragraph blocks. Here is an example for the
      <a href="nksp.html">NKSP script language</a>.
    </p>
    <code>
<p>
  Paragraph just before the source code block.
</p>
&lt;code&gt;
on init
  @foo := "A message"
  message(@foo)
end on
&lt;/code&gt;
<p>
  Next paragraph just after the source code block.
</p>
    </code>
    <p>
      Which would appear like:
    </p>
    <example>
      <p>
        Paragraph just before the source code block.
      </p>
      <code lang="nksp">
on init
  @foo := "A message"
  message(@foo)
end on      
      </code>
      <p>
        Next paragraph just after the source code block.
      </p>
    </example>
    <p>
      The source code automatically appears nicely in color and with line
      numbers between the two paragraphs. This site's software will also take
      care about removing white lines at the front and end of your source code
      blocks appropriately.
    </p>

    <h3>Embedded Code</h3>
    <p>
      In case you are mentioning a very small part of the source code in your
      text, then you probably might want that to be displayed actually as source code
      directly embedded into your paragraph. You might already guess how to
      do that: simply put the code block into the paragraph text block of your
      HTML file:
    </p>
    <code>
<p>
  A variable is assigned with NKSP like this &lt;code&gt;$foo := 5&lt;/code&gt;, in this
  case you are assigning &lt;code&gt;5&lt;/code&gt; to the integer variable &lt;code&gt;$foo&lt;/code&gt;.
</p>
    </code>
    <p>
      And this would be the result:
    </p>
    <example>
      <p>
        A variable is assigned with NKSP like this <code lang="nksp">$foo := 5</code>, in this
        case you are assigning <code lang="nksp">5</code> to the integer variable <code lang="nksp">$foo</code>.
      </p>
    </example>
    <p>
      That looks now much more easier to read, doesn't it?
    </p>

    <note>
      Syntax highlighting of source code is automatically generated by our site's software
      once the document is uploaded to our server. So when you are just
      previewing your article with source code snippets on your local machine,
      then those source code snippets will yet be displayed monochrome,
      without any syntax highlighting.
    </note>
    
    <h3>Metaphors</h3>
    <p>
      You might have noticed, we have used a special kind of <code>??place-holder??</code> for 
      human-readable portions in source code before, which shall outline to the reader
      that it is not actually "real" source code, but just reflecting its semantic meaning.
      Simply put the respective pseudo-code into a pair of two question marks,
      like so:
    </p>
    <code>
&lt;code&gt;
on init
  declare const $i = \?\?some-value\?\?
  
  message(\?\?text-string\?\?)
end on
&lt;/code&gt;
    </code>
    <p>
      Which will look like this:
    </p>
    <example>
      <code lang="nksp">
on init
  declare const $i = ??some-value??
  
  message(??text-string??)
end on
      </code>
    </example>
    <p>
      These <i>metaphors</i> are especially useful in beginners tutorials for 
      clearly separating real source code portions from pseudo-code portions,
      and to point the reader's eyes to the most important locations of your
      source code snippet.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Links and Article File Names</h2>
    <p>
      If you want to add links in your article to another article or to some
      other website, then you just use an ordinary HTML link tag pair:
    </p>
    <code>
<p>
  This paragraph contains &lt;a href="../nksp.html"&gt;a link to another article&lt;/a&gt;
  and to &lt;a href="http://www.linuxsampler.org"&gt;another website&lt;/a&gt;.
</p>
    </code>
    <example>
<p>
  This paragraph contains <a href="../nksp.html">a link to another article</a>
  and to <a href="http://www.linuxsampler.org">another website</a>.
</p>
    </example>
    <p>
      Concerning links to other websites, there is nothing special for you to know about.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regarding local links to another article however: these are monitored
      similar like references to image files (as <a href="#unique_pictures">described before</a>), that is
      our system automatically detects if the path of some of your local links to
      another article is incorrect, i.e. because the website structure changed
      in the meantime, and it will automatically correct the path to the correct
      location of the article for you, without requiring any user intervention.
      For this reason, all articles must have unique file names for the entire
      site, no matter in which directory the respective article's HTML file is
      located at exactly.
    </p>
    <p>  
      An article file on our site usually has the following
      file name form:
    </p>
    <code>
??number-prefix??_??unique-name??.html
    </code>
    <p>
      The <code>??number-prefix??</code> is optional. It allows us to control
      the order of articles on the same website structure level (i.e.
      concerning its location in the navigation bar).
      The <code>??unique-name??</code> portion of the file name though is actually the
      relevant part our site's software is looking at. This "root" of its file
      name must be globally unique among our entire site. If you add a new
      article to our site with a file name that is already taken by another
      article, then our system will automatically inform you via email to
      resolve this issue by renaming one of them. Also note that the file name
      just acts as internal ID while writing articles. The original file name
      of the input HTML file will not be directly exposed to readers on our
      documentation site.
    </p>

    <h2>Terms</h2>
    <p>
      Technical terms and abbreviations are often used in articles to reduce
      the amount of text for transmitting some kind of information about a
      certain topic to the reader. You might want to emphasize technical terms and abbreviations
      in your article, by wrapping the term into a pair of <code><i></code> HTML
      tags. On our site this will not only show the term in a special unified
      font style (currently italic), but it allows you also to define the
      meaning of the term <b>once</b>. Which goes like this:
    </p>
    
    <h3>Defining a Term</h3>
     <p>
      You may define a new term like this:
    </p>
    <code>
<p>
  He left the bar and jumped right into his
  &lt;i title="A very large vehicle."&gt;Mega Liner&lt;/i&gt;
  to follow the street right into sunset.
</p>
    </code>
    <example>
<p>
  He left the bar and jumped right into his
  <i title="A very large truck vehicle.">Mega Liner</i>
  to follow the street right into sunset.
</p>
    </example>
    <p>
      Now when you point your mouse over the term, a popup will appear,
      describing the meaning of the term. 
    </p>

    <h3>Referencing an already defined Term</h3>
    <p>
      Obviously you don't want to define
      the same term over and over again, just to provide the user the meaning of
      it at any occurence of the site. That's why our software does that
      automatically for you once your article is uploaded to our server. Now
      when you use the term at another place, i.e. in another article, then
      it will automatically have the same meaning attached to it:
    </p>
    <code>
<p>
  Once again he was sitting behind the wheel of his &lt;i&gt;Mega Liner&lt;/i&gt;,
  but things were different back then.
</p>
    </code>
    <example>
<p>
  Once again he was sitting behind the wheel of his <i>Mega Liner</i>, but
  things were different back then.
</p>
    </example>
    <p>
      Point your mouse again over the term, and you will notice that the same
      term definition will popup as tooltip, like at its original location where
      it was defined before.
    <p>
    </p>
      Due to this fact, our site's software does not even allow you to define the
      same term more than once (at least not with a different meaning that is).
      It will scan all documents in our current pool and if somebody tries to
      re-declare an already existing term again with a different meaning, he
      will automatically be notified by our system via email and kindly asked
      to resolve the ambiguousness.
    </p>
    <note>
      Our system automatically handles redundant variants of terms. That means
      first of all, that all term names are stored, compared and looked up case insensitive,
      and the system automatically tries to auto complete i.e. plural forms
      of the same term.
    </note>
    
    <h2>Tables</h2>
    <p>
      Tables are written like ordinary HTML tables. That is:
    </p>
    <code>
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Name&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Foo&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Some text.&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Bar&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;And more text.&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Thing&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;And that's it.&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
    </code>
    <example>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Name</th> <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Foo</td> <td>Some text.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Bar</td> <td>And more text.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Thing</td> <td>And that's it.</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </example>
    <p>
      So <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code> wraps up individual rows of a table,
      <code>&lt;th&gt;</code> contains the individual cells of the table header,
      and <code>&lt;td&gt;</code> contains the individual cells of the table's
      body.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Note Boxes</h2>
    <p>
      Once in a while you need to inform the reader about noteworthy issues.
      For this purpose we are using a special <code>&lt;note&gt;</code> tag.
    </p>
    <h3>Regular Notes</h3>
    <p>
      To add regular notes to your article with low or normal importance, add
      the note like this:
    </p>
    <code>
&lt;note&gt;
  This is an issue you need to know about. Please read this carefully to avoid
  making any mistakes.
&lt;/note&gt;  
    </code>
    <example>
      <note>
         This is an issue you need to know about. Please read this carefully to avoid
         making any mistakes.
      </note>
    </example>
    <p>
      This is not a regular HTML tag defined in the HTML standard, but with
      modern browsers supporting CSS3, it should display just as intended.
    </p>

    <h3>Important Notes</h3>
    <p>
      If you need to inform the reader about a very important issue instead,
      then you might use the following slightly different form:
    </p>
    <code>
&lt;note class="important"&gt;
  Now this is a very important issue you need to be aware of. If you ignore it,
  your task will fail.
&lt;/note&gt;  
    </code>
    <example>
      <note class="important">
         Now this is a very important issue you need to be aware of. If you ignore it,
         your task will fail.
      </note>
    </example>
    <p>
      The only thing that changed compared to the regular note, is the "class"
      attribute of the note tag.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Extensions</h2>
    <p>
      This is almost the end of this article. You are still seeking for features
      for one of your articles, that are not already covered by our system?
      Then either ask <a href="http://www.linuxsampler.org/developers.html#Schoenebeck">Christian</a>
      whether that feature could be added, or ... extend your article on your
      own. It's real HTML after all! So you can add your own HTML, CSS and
      Java Script to your articles at any time!
    </p>
    
    <h2>What next?</h2>
    <p>
      You are at the end of our tour introducing our documentation system.
      You may now start writing your first article. Once you are done with it,
      simply
      <a href="http://www.linuxsampler.org/developers.html">
        send your article to some of us
      </a>, or request an account to our Subversion repository, so you can
      manage articles of our documentation site on your own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thanks for your support!

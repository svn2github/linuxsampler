    <h1>SFZ</h1>
    <p>
      The SFZ file format is a human readable instrument definition file format
      for audio sample based virtual instruments. In contrast to many other
      sampler file formats you can open and modify such .sfz files simply with
      any text editor.
    </p>
    <note>
      This SFZ documentation is yet under construction. In the meantime you may want to
      have a look at the old and currently still separate list of <a href="http://linuxsampler.org/sfz/">opcodes supported by LinuxSampler</a>.
      You want to help filling up the missing information about the SFZ file format on this site? Great!
      Check out the <a href="http://svn.linuxsampler.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/doc/docbase/sfz/">source files of this SFZ documentation</a>
      on our Subversion server and <a href="http://linuxsampler.org/developers.html">get in touch with us</a>!
      There is also a short guide for getting started on <a href="../writing_docs/01_writing_docs.html">writing articles for this site</a>.

    <h2>Sections</h2>
    <p>
      A sfz file is divided into sections. A section defines in which context
      the subsequent statements in the sfz file shall be interpreted as. For example
      You may want to declare a lowpass filter to be used either for the entire
      sfz instrument, or you may declare the lowpass filter to be only used for
      a certain region on the keyboard instead. A section is introduced by
      its section name, where the section name is placed in a pair of angle brackets.
      The section name is then followed by the respective sfz opcodes which shall be
      assigned to that particular section. The sections available with sfz are:
    </p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Section</th> <th>Standard</th> <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code lang="sfz">&lt;global&gt;</code></td> <td>SFZ v1</td> <td>Declarations which shall apply to the entire instrument.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code lang="sfz">&lt;group&gt;</code></td> <td>SFZ v1</td> <td>TODO ...</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code lang="sfz">&lt;region&gt;</code></td> <td>SFZ v1</td> <td>TODO ...</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code lang="sfz">&lt;control&gt;</code></td> <td>?</td> <td>TODO ...</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code lang="sfz">&lt;curve&gt;</code></td> <td>?</td> <td>TODO ...</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code lang="sfz">&lt;effect&gt;</code></td> <td>?</td> <td>TODO ...</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <h2>Opcodes</h2>
    <p>
      The actual individual statements which make up the articulation
      definition of a sfz instrument are called <i>opcodes</i>. For example there
      is an opcode for loading and assigning a sample file to be played. And
      there is an opcode for defining envelope parameters, and so on.
      The opcodes available with the SFZ file format are:
    </p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Opcode</th> <th>Standard</th> <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code lang="sfz">sample</code></td> <td>SFZ v1</td> <td>Load and assign an audio sample file.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code lang="sfz">script</code></td> <td>LinuxSampler Ext.</td> <td>Load an real-time instrument script for the instrument.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>TODO ...</td> <td></td> <td></td>
      </tr>
    </table>

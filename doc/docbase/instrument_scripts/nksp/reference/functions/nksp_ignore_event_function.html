    <h1>ignore_event()</h1>
    <p>
      Drops the given event and thus prevents the supplied event to be further
      processed by the sampler. You can use this function i.e. to filter out
      MIDI note on and MIDI note off events, before they are causing new notes
      to be triggered, or to drop certain MIDI control change events before
      they can cause any sound to be changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dropping events with this function only succeeds if the event just
      "recently" occurred. That effectively means you should drop the event in
      the respective event handler before any <code>wait() calls, and before
      entering any loops that may execute your script for a very long time.
      Because in both cases the sampler may suspend your script for a certain
      amount of time and once your script got resumed, the respective event may
      already have entered the sampler's regular event processing chain and
      thus can no longer be dropped.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is also an <code lang="nksp">ignore_controller()</code> function,
      intended for explicitly dropping control change events. With NKSP you
      you can also use <code>ignore_event()</code> though to
      drop control change events. So <code>ignore_controller()</code>
      merely exists due to compatibility reasons with KSP.

    <h3>Function Prototype</h3>
    <p/>
    <code>
ignore_event(??event-id??)
    </code>

    <h3>Arguments</h3>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Argument Name</th> <th>Data Type</th> <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>??event-id??</code></td>
        <td>Event ID Number or Event ID Array</td>
        <td>MIDI event(s) to be dropped.<br>
            [required]</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    
    <h3>Return Value</h3>
    <p>None.</p>
    
    <h3>Examples</h3>
    <p>None yet.<p>

    <note>
      Passing an array of event IDs is only supported by NKSP. If you want
      to keep compatibility to KSP, then you should only pass a single
      event ID to this function.

    <h1>ignore_event()</h1>
    <p>
      Drops the given event and thus prevents the supplied event to be further
      processed by the sampler. You can use this function i.e. to filter out
      MIDI note on and MIDI note off events, before they are causing new notes
      to be triggered.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is also an <code>ignore_controller()</code> function. With
      NKSP the two functions are both doing the same thing though.
      The two exist merely due to compatibility reasons with KSP.

    <h3>Function Prototype</h3>
    <p/>
    <code>
ignore_event(??event-id??)
    </code>

    <h3>Arguments</h3>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Argument Name</th> <th>Data Type</th> <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>??event-id??</code></td>
        <td>Event ID Number or Event ID Array</td>
        <td>MIDI event(s) to be dropped.<br>
            [required]</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    
    <h3>Return Value</h3>
    <p>None.</p>
    
    <h3>Examples</h3>
    <p>None yet.<p>

    <note>
      Passing an array of event IDs is only supported by NKSP. If you want
      to keep compatibility to KSP, then you should only pass a single
      event ID to this function.

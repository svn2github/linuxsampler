    <note class="important">
      The message() function is not appropriate for being used with your final
      production sounds, since it can lead to audio dropouts.
      You should only use the message() function to try out things, and to spot
      and debug problems with your scripts. Same applies to all text string
      variables in general. Don't use any
      <a href="nksp.html#string_variables">string variables</a> in your final
      production sounds.
      You may use <a href="nksp.html#preprocessor_statements">preprocessor statements</a>
      to handle this effectively.

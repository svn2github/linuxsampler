    <h1>exit()</h1>
    <p>
      Stops execution of the current event handler instance.
      It does <b>not</b> stop execution of other
      instances of the same event handler, nor does it stop execution of other
      handlers of other event types, and especially it does <b>not</b> stop or
      prevent further or future execution of your entire script! In other words,
      you should rather see this function as a return statement, in case you are
      familiar with other programming languages already.

    <h1>change_cutoff()</h1>
    <p>
      This function can be used to modify the filter cutoff frequency of active
      voices during their entire life time. You need to pass the
      note ID of the voices you want to alter. This function will change the
      cutoff frequency of all active voices associated with the requested note. So if you
      are using a layered instrument patch, then it will change the cutoff frequency of
      all layers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cutoff frequency changes set by calling this function are always applied relatively to
      the cutoff frequency calculated by the synthesis model and sampler format. That means
      the various sources of cutoff frequency factors like Filter Envelopes,
      Filter LFOs and other cutoff frequency factors that may be defined by the
      instrument patch, are always processed and calculated for the voices first,
      and the final cutoff frequency applied is always a relative combination of all those
      factors and the one set with this function call.
      Or in other words: you cannot replace the cutoff frequency set by other synthesis
      sources with this function.
    </p>
    
    <note class="important">
    There will only be audible changes with this function if a filter is
    actually already turned on (i.e. by enabling it in the instrument patch)
    and only if the filter is not closed by other sources (i.e. cutoff frequency
    should be set open in the instrument patch).
    </note>

    <note>
    Release Trigger Samples: In case the affected voices cause release trigger
    samples to be spawned later on, the cutoff frequency of those release trigger voices
    will not be affected by this function at all. So if you need to control the
    cutoff frequency of release trigger samples by script, then you might rather also trigger
    those release trigger samples by script with <code lang="nksp">play_note()</code>
    instead of using the sampler format's internal support for release trigger samples.

    <h3>Return Value</h3>
    <p>None.</p>

    <h3>Examples</h3>
    <p>None yet.<p>

    <h3>Availabilty</h3>
    <p>Since LinuxSampler 2.0.0.svn12.<p>

    <note>
    This function exists only with NKSP, it is not available with KSP, because
    KSP does not allow to change filter parameters on note level.

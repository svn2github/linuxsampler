    <h1>wait()</h1>
    <p>
      Suspends / pauses the current event handler instance for the requested
      amount of microseconds.

    <code>
on init
  { The amount of notes to play }
  declare const $delayNotes := 4
  { Tempo with which the new notes will follow the orignal note }
  declare const $bpm := 90
  { Convert BPM to microseconds (duration between the notes) }
  declare const $delayMicroSeconds := 60 * 1000000 / $bpm
  { Just a working variable for being used with the while loop below }
  declare polyphonic $i
  { For each successive note we trigger, we will reduce the velocity a bit}
  declare polyphonic $velocity
end on

on note
  { First initialize the variable $i with 4 each time we enter this event
    handler, because each time we executed this handler, the variable will be 0 }
  $i := $delayNotes

  { Loop which will be executed 4 times in a row }
  while ($i)
    { Calculate the velocity for the next note being triggered }
    $velocity := 127 * $i / ($delayNotes + 1)
    { Suspend this script for a short moment ... }
    wait($delayMicroSeconds)
    { ... and after that short break, trigger a new note. }
    play_note($EVENT_NOTE, $velocity)
    { Decrement loop counter $i by one }
    $i := $i - 1
  end while
end on
    </code>
    
    <note class="important">
      Using the <code>wait()</code> function can lead to concurrency issues with
      regular variables, which are global variables by default. You might need
      to use <a href="nksp.html#polyphonic_variables">polyphonic variables</a>
      in such cases.

    <note class="important">
      The <code>wait()</code> function is not fully implemented in LinuxSampler
      yet. Currently a <code>wait()</code> function call suspends execution,
      but since the respective scheduler code is yet missing in LinuxSampler,
      the script will automatically be resumed with the next audio fragment
      cycle. So effectively a <code>wait()</code> call will pause your script
      for a few miliseconds with LinuxSampler right now, no matter which
      function argument you provided. Hopefully this will be implemented soon
      though.

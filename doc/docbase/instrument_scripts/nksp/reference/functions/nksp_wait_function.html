    <h1>wait()</h1>
    <p>
      Suspends / pauses execution of the current event handler instance for the requested
      amount of microseconds. The paused event handler instance can also be resumed before
      the requested amount times elapsed by calling <code lang="nksp">stop_wait()</code> from another
      event handler instance.
    </p>
    <note>
      If the even handler instance's built-in variable <code>$NKSP_IGNORE_WAIT</code>
      reflects <code>1</code> then all calls to <code>wait()</code> will be ignored.
      This might for example be the case when <code>stop_wait()</code> with
      <code>1</code> being passed to the 2nd argument of that function.

    <h3>Examples</h3>
    <p/>
    <code>
on init
  { The amount of notes to play }
  declare const $delayNotes := 4
  { Tempo with which the new notes will follow the orignal note }
  declare const $bpm := 90
  { Convert BPM to microseconds (duration between the notes) }
  declare const $delayMicroSeconds := 60 * 1000000 / $bpm
  { Just a working variable for being used with the while loop below }
  declare polyphonic $i
  { For each successive note we trigger, we will reduce the velocity a bit}
  declare polyphonic $velocity
end on

on note
  { First initialize the variable $i with 4 each time we enter this event
    handler, because each time we executed this handler, the variable will be 0 }
  $i := $delayNotes

  { Loop which will be executed 4 times in a row }
  while ($i)
    { Calculate the velocity for the next note being triggered }
    $velocity := 127 * $i / ($delayNotes + 1)
    { Suspend this script for a short moment ... }
    wait($delayMicroSeconds)
    { ... and after that short break, trigger a new note. }
    play_note($EVENT_NOTE, $velocity)
    { Decrement loop counter $i by one }
    $i := $i - 1
  end while
end on
    </code>
    
    <note>
      Using the <code>wait()</code> function can lead to concurrency issues with
      regular variables, which are global variables by default. You might need
      to use <a href="nksp.html#polyphonic_variables">polyphonic variables</a>
      in such cases.
    </note>
    
    <note>
      You need at least LinuxSampler 2.0.0.svn2 or higher for the
      <code>wait()</code> function to fully work as expected. Versions
      of LinuxSampler older than that will not resume the script at the
      requested amount of time, instead those older version will resume
      the script always at the beginning of the next audio fragment
      cycle. So effectively a <code>wait()</code> call with a LinuxSampler
      version older than 2.0.0.svn2 will pause your script for a few
      miliseconds, no matter which function argument you provided.

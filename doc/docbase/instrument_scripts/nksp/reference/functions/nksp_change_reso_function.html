    <p>
      This function can be used to modify the filter resonance of active
      voices during their entire life time. You need to pass the
      note ID of the voices you want to alter. This function will change the
      resonance of all active voices associated with the requested note. So if you
      are using a layered instrument patch, then it will change the filter resonance of
      all layers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The resonance changes set by calling this function are always applied relatively to
      the resonance calculated by the synthesis model and sampler format. That means
      the various sources of resonance factors like Filter Envelopes,
      Filter LFOs and other resonance factors that may be defined by the
      instrument patch, are always processed and calculated for the voices first,
      and the final resonance applied is always a relative combination of all those
      factors and the one set with this function call.
      Or in other words: you cannot replace the resonance set by other synthesis
      sources with this function.
    </p>

    <note class="important">
    There will only be audible changes with this function if a filter is
    actually already turned on (i.e. by enabling it in the instrument patch)
    and only if the filter is not closed by other sources (i.e. cutoff frequency
    should be set open in the instrument patch).
    </note>

    <note>
    Release Trigger Samples: In case the affected voices cause release trigger
    samples to be spawned later on, the resonance of those release trigger voices
    will not be affected by this function at all. So if you need to control the
    resonance of release trigger samples by script, then you might rather also trigger
    those release trigger samples by script with <code lang="nksp">play_note()</code>
    instead of using the sampler format's internal support for release trigger samples.

        <th>Argument Name</th> <th>Data Type</th> <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>??note??</code></td>
        <td>Note ID Number or Note ID Array</td>
        <td>All voices of this note will be modified.<br>

      <tr>
        <td><code>??resonance??</code></td>
        <td>Integer Number</td>
        <td>New Resonance Value (abstract absolute value between 0 and 1000000).<br>
            [required]</td>

    </table>

    <h3>Return Value</h3>
    <p>None.</p>

    <h3>Examples</h3>
    <p>None yet.<p>

    <h3>Availabilty</h3>
    <p>Since LinuxSampler 2.0.0.svn12.<p>

    <note>
    This function exists only with NKSP, it is not available with KSP, because
    KSP does not allow to change filter parameters on note level.

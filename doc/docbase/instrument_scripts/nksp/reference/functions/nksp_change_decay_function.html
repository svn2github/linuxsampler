    <h1>change_decay()</h1>
    <p>
      This function can be used to modify the decay time of active voices of a
      particular note. 
      In contrast to other synthesis parameter related functions,
      this function only allows to change the decay time when the respective note
      is new, that is either i.e. at the beginning of a <code lang="nksp">note</code>
      event handler or right after calling <code>play_note()</code>. So you should
      perform the decay value change as soon as possible, especially before calling any
      <code>wait()</code> function and before entering a loop which might take a
      long time to execute (which might cause your script to get
      forcely suspended by the script engine due to real-time constraints).
    </p>
    <p>
      The decay time changes set by calling this function are always applied relatively to
      the decay time calculated by the synthesis model and sampler format. That means
      the various sources of volume factors like MIDI CCs and other decay parameter
      factors that may be defined by the instrument patch, are always processed and
      calculated for the voices first, and the final decay time applied is always
      a relative combination of all those factors and the one set with this function call.
      Or in other words: you cannot replace the volume set by other synthesis
      sources with this function.
    </p>

    <note class="important">
    Release Trigger Samples: In case the affected voices cause release trigger
    samples to be spawned later on, the decay time of those release trigger voices
    will not be affected by this function at all. So if you need to control the
    decay time of release trigger samples by script, then you might rather also trigger
    those release trigger samples by script with <code lang="nksp">play_note()</code>
    instead of using the sampler format's internal support for release trigger samples.

    <h1>change_vol()</h1>
    <p>
      This function can be used to modify the volume of active voices during
      their entire life time. So you may for example implement very sophisticated
      volume envelopes by script by using this function. You need to pass the
      note ID of the voices you want to alter. This function will change the
      volume of all active voices associated with the requested note. So if you
      are using a layered instrument patch, then it will change the volume of
      all layers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The volume changes set by calling function are always applied relatively to
      the volume calculated by the synthesis model and sampler format. That means
      the various sources of volume factors like MIDI CC #7, Amplitute Envelopes,
      Amplitutude LFOs and other volume factors that may be defined by the
      instrument patch, are always processed and calculated for the voices first,
      and the final volume applied is always a relative combination of all those
      factors and the one set with this function call. This does also not change
      when you pass <code>1</code> for argument <code>??relative??</code>.
      Or in other words: you cannot replace the volume set by other synthesis
      sources with this function.
    </p>

    <note class="important">
    Release Trigger Samples: In case the affected voices cause release trigger
    samples to be spawned later on, the volume of those release trigger voices
    will not be affected by this function at all. So if you need to control the
    volume of release trigger samples by script, then you might rather also trigger
    those release trigger samples by script with <code lang="nksp">play_note()</code>
    instead of using the sampler format's internal support for release trigger samples.

            A positive value increases the volume,

        <td>Whether change_vol() calls should be relative to each other.<br>
            0: A call to <code>change_vol()</code> upon the same note will
               replace the volume change value set by previous
               <code>change_vol()</code> calls upon the same note.<br>
            1: Successive calls to <code>change_vol()</code> upon the same
               note will be relatively applied against each other.<br>

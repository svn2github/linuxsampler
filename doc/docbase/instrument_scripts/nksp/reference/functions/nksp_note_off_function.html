    <h1>note_off()</h1>
    <p>
      Releases a note by passing the note's event ID to this function.
      This is almost like sending a MIDI note off event programmatically, however
      a call to this function will only release one single note instead,
      a call to this function does not cause a <code lang="nksp">release</code>
      event handler to be executed, nor will any MIDI specific note-off handling
      be done (i.e. it will have no effect on the status of built-in array variable
      <code>%KEY_DOWN[]</code>).
    </p>

    <h3>Function Prototype</h3>
    <p/>
    <code>
note_off(??event-id??, [??velocity??])
    </code>

    <h3>Arguments</h3>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Argument Name</th> <th>Data Type</th> <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>??event-id??</code></td>
        <td>Event ID Number or Event ID Array</td>
        <td>Note ID(s) of the note(s) to be released.<br>
            [required]</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>??velocity??</code></td>
        <td>Integer Number</td>
        <td>MIDI note off velocity value.<br>
            [optional, default: 127]</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    
    <h3>Return Value</h3>
    <p>None.</p>
    
    <h3>Examples</h3>
    <p>None yet.<p>

    <note>
      Passing an array of event IDs is only supported by NKSP. If you want
      to keep compatibility to KSP, then you should only pass a single
      event ID to this function.
    </note>
    
    <note>
      The second argument of this function <code>??velocity??</code> is only
      supported by NKSP. If you want to keep compatibility with KSP, then you
      should only pass one argument to this function.

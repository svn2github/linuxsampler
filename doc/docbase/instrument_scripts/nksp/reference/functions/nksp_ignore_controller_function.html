    <h1>ignore_controller()</h1>
    <p>
      Drops the given MIDI control change event and thus prevents the supplied
      event to be further processed by the sampler. You can use this function
      i.e. to filter out MIDI control change events, before they are causing
      any sound to be changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The argument this function takes is optional. If you omit passing an
      argument to this function, then the controller event ID will be used that
      caused this current <code lang="nksp">controller</code> event handler to be executed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dropping control change events with this function only succeeds if the
      event just "recently" occurred. That effectively means you should drop
      the control change event in the <code>controller</code> event handler
      before any <code>wait()</code> calls, and before entering any loops that may
      execute your script for a very long time. Because in both cases the
      sampler may suspend your script for a certain amount of time and once
      your script got resumed, the respective control change event may already
      have entered the sampler's regular event processing chain and thus can no
      longer be dropped.
    </p>
    <p>
      With NKSP you can also use <code>ignore_event()</code> to drop control
      change events. So <code>ignore_controller()</code> merely exists due to
      compatibility reasons with KSP. However when you already know that the
      event to be dropped is a control change event, then it is recommended to
      actually call <code>ignore_controller()</code> instead of
      <code>ignore_event()</code>.

    <h3>Function Prototype</h3>
    <p/>
    <code>
ignore_controller([??event-id??])
    </code>

    <h3>Arguments</h3>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Argument Name</th> <th>Data Type</th> <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>??event-id??</code></td>
        <td>Event ID Number</td>
        <td>MIDI control change event to be dropped.<br>
            [optional, default: ID of the event handler's event]</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    
    <h3>Return Value</h3>
    <p>None.</p>
    
    <h3>Examples</h3>
    <p>None yet.<p>

    <note>
      Dynamic, optional arguments are only supported by NKSP. If you want to
      retain compatibility to KSP, then you should always pass a parameter
      to this function.

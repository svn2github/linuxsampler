    <h1>play_note()</h1>
    <p>
      Triggers a new note to be played by the sampler. This is like generating
      a new MIDI note-on event programmatically, with the difference though
      that triggering a note programmatically this way does not cause a
      <code>note</code> event handler to be executed for the new note.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Function Prototype</h3>
    <p/>
    <code lang="nksp">
play_note(??note??, [??velocity??], [??offset-us??], [??duration-us??])
    </code>

    <h3>Arguments</h3>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Argument Name</th> <th>Data Type</th> <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>??note??</code></td>
        <td>Integer Number</td>
        <td>Note number (absolute pitch).<br>
            [required]</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>??velocity??</code></td>
        <td>Integer Number</td>
        <td>Trigger velocity.<br>
            [optional, default: 127]</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>??offset-us??</code></td>
        <td>Integer Number</td>
        <td>Start offset of the sample to be played in microseconds.<br>
            [optional, default: 0]</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>??duration-us??</code></td>
        <td>Integer Number</td>
        <td>Length of the note to be played in microseconds.<br>
            -1: The note will be stopped when the event
                handler's note stops (must only be used with
                <code>note</code> event handlers).<br>
            0: The entire note's sample will be played to its end.<br>
            [optional, default: 0]</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <note>
    You need at least LinuxSampler 2.0.0.svn2 or higher for passing a value
    higher than <code>0</code> for <code>??duration-us??</code>, and you need
    at least LinuxSampler 2.0.0.svn3 or higher for passing <code>-1</code> for
    <code>??duration-us??</code>.
    </note>

    <note class="important">
    Passing any other value than <code>0</code> for <code>??offset-us??</code>
    is not supported by LinuxSampler yet.

    <h3>Return Value</h3>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Description</th> <th>Data Type</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Note's event ID of the new note that has been triggered. This event ID can be
            used to control the note during its life time.</td>
        <td>Event ID Number</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    
    <h3>Examples</h3>
    <p/>
    <code>
on init
  { The amount of notes to play }
  declare const $delayNotes := 4
  { Tempo with which the new notes will follow the orignal note }
  declare const $bpm := 90
  { Convert BPM to microseconds (duration between the notes) }
  declare const $delayMicroSeconds := 60 * 1000000 / $bpm
  { Just a working variable for being used with the while loop below }
  declare polyphonic $i
  { For each successive note we trigger, we will reduce the velocity a bit}
  declare polyphonic $velocity
end on

on note
  { First initialize the variable $i with 4 each time we enter this event
    handler, because each time we executed this handler, the variable will be 0 }
  $i := $delayNotes

  { Loop which will be executed 4 times in a row }
  while ($i)
    { Calculate the velocity for the next note being triggered }
    $velocity := 127 * $i / ($delayNotes + 1)
    { Suspend this script for a short moment ... }
    wait($delayMicroSeconds)
    { ... and after that short break, trigger a new note. }
    play_note($EVENT_NOTE, $velocity)
    { Decrement loop counter $i by one }
    $i := $i - 1
  end while
end on

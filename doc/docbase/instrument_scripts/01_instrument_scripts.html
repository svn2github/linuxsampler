    <h1>Real-Time Instrument Scripts</h1>
    <p>
      The sampler technology is constantly evolving to satisfy new feature
      requirements of sound designer in order to allow them creating more and
      more realistic sounds. As an example you might look at state of the art
      orchestra libraries. They not only allow you pick one of the individual
      instrument sounds of an orchestra, they also allow you to control the
      articulation of the respective orchestra instrument while playing them
      live with your keyboard. So you might start playing an interesting intro
      with a string ensemble in
      <i title="Technique that uses a bowing style that leaves the string clearly to produce a light 'bouncing' sound.">spiccato</i>
      playing style, then you might go over into a slow bridge part where the
      string ensemble is resembling a
      <i title="Of successive notes in performance, connected without any intervening silence of articulation.">legato</i>
      articulation or even
      <i title="Portamento is a continous pitch sliding from one note to another.">portamento</i>
      in between, which makes that part of the song very calm and
      relaxed, and then you shock your audience all of a sudden with a loud
      <i title="Staccato signifies a note of shortened duration, separated from the note that may follow by silence.">staccato</i>,
      automatically supported by kettledrum and brass sounds, that wakes up even
      the last one in the back row. And the best thing: you did not switch to
      another instrument during that entire song.
    </p>

    <h3>Technical Challenge</h3>
    <p>
      Adding these kinds of features to a sampler had long been a challenge for
      software developers. On one hand you need to provide the musician
      additional controls to let him switch between such kind of orchestra
      articulations. Sound designers came up with various ideas to let the
      keyboard player do this. For example by
      <ul>
        <li>using continous controllers like the keyboard's modulation wheel</li>
        <li>using a dedicated keys section on the keyboard where each key selects another playing style</li>
        <li>utilizing aftertouch support of keyboards</li>
      </ul>
      and some more. And on the other hand developers needed to extend the
      sampler software and the instrument file format to deal with all those
      extensions. Thinking about <i>portamento</i> for example, the sampler not
      only has to pick the right sample for the first key the keyboard player
      hits, the sampler also has to detect the next note and needs to pick a
      special dedicated portamento sample that goes specifically from that one
      note to that other note. If the sampler would do that synthetically
      instead, then it would sound synthetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      And if that was not enough, sound designers started even to ask for very
      exotic features, specifically for just a bunch of sounds or even for just
      one single sound of
      theirs, for example
      a specific note pattern that shall automatically be added by the sampler
      to each note being played by the keyboard player.
      The requested feature set became such large, that sampler developers
      failed to put all this into their stock sampler software package.
      A completely new solution was required.
    </p>

    <h3>Scripts as Solution</h3>
    <p>
      Instead of bloating the sampler engine with more and more suboptimal
      features that not really suited anybody, the sampler developers turned the
      way around and opened the sampler engine for sound designers, so that they
      could add their own custom software components and bundle them with their
      sounds. These kinds of software plugins that are directly glued and
      shipped with sounds are called <i>Instrument Scripts</i>, they extend
      the sampler software with new software features required by the
      respective sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sound designers were finally free to add their own features to the sampler
      and used <i>Instrument Scripts</i> extensively to create stunning new
      sounds. For example they came up with a feature called
      <i title="Sympathetic resonance is a harmonic phenomenon wherein a formerly passive string responds to external vibrations to which it has a harmonic likeness.">
        symphatetic resonance
      </i> for their piano sound libraries, which brought piano sounds another
      great leap forward to match their real, physical counter parts.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Using Scripts with LinuxSampler</h2>
    <p>
      LinuxSampler allows you to write and use such <i>Instrument Scripts</i>
      as well. At the moment support for instrument scripts is provided by
      the GigaStudio format engine, as well as now also by the SFZ format engine of
      LinuxSampler. The script engine was developed in a very modular design,
      where most of the script engine's software is independent from the
      actual sampler format and the respective sampler format engine is just
      adding its format specific extensions to the script language. For example
      the GigaStudio format engine adds scripting functions to allow the sound
      designer to control the dimension region by scripts.
    </p>

    <h3 id="gig">Bundling Scripts with GigaStudio (.gig) Files</h3>
    <p>
      Our graphical instrument editor for the GigaStudio format - <i>gigedit</i> -
      includes an instrument script editor and allows you to attach
      instrument scripts to individual GigaStudio format sounds. Refer to the
      gigedit manual for <a href="gigedit_scripts.html">how to manage instrument scripts with gigedit.</a>
    </p>

    <h3 id="sfz">Bundling Scripts with SFZ (.sfz) Files</h3>
    <p>
      LinuxSampler adds a new opcode <code lang="sfz">script</code> as an
      extension to the offical SFZ format. Similar to the <code lang="sfz">sample</code>
      opcode, a file system path needs to be assigned to the actual script file that should
      be loaded by the sampler. The <code lang="sfz">script</code> opcode should be placed
      in the SFZ file's <code lang="sfz">&lt;global&gt;</code> section. However at the moment
      the precise location of the opcode will simply be ignored by LinuxSampler. A simple example
      SFZ file may look like this:
    </p>
    <code lang="sfz">
// real-time instrument scripts should be loaded in global section
&lt;global&gt;
script=path/to/my_nksp_script.txt

// just load one audio file and assign in to entire key range
&lt;group&gt;
sample=some_sound.wav
    </code>
    <p>
      At the moment LinuxSampler supports only one script file per instrument.
      Accordingly there should only be one <code lang="sfz">script</code> opcode
      occurrence in your SFZ file. If you place more than one
      <code lang="sfz">script</code> opcode to a SFZ file, then only the first
      script will be loaded and the sampler will print a warning. In future this will
      change, and the sampler will support running multiple scripts, and will run
      the scripts subsequently on events according to the order the scripts appeared
      in the SFZ file.
    </p>

    <h3>Learning the Script Language</h3>
    <p>
      You certainly find some instrument scripts ready to be used on the
      Internet. So you can simply download and attach them to your sounds with
      <i>gigedit</i>. In order to write your own custom instrument scripts though, you
      need to get in touch with the scripting language. Refer to the
      <a href="nksp.html">NKSP Language Tour</a>
      for learning how to write your own scripts.
    </p>

    <h3>Script Language Reference</h3>
    <p>
      If you are already familiar with the instrument script language basics,
      and just need details and examples to the individual built-in functions
      and built-in variables, then refer to the
      <a href="nksp_reference.html">NKSP Reference Manual</a>.

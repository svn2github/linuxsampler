    <h1>NKSP Script Editor</h1>    
    <p>
      There is some progress regarding the <a href="nksp.html">NKSP instrument script</a>
      editor. With LinuxSampler 2.0.0.svn8 and gigedit 1.0.0.svn13 working on
      instrument scripts for sounds became much more convenient. Gigedit's integrated
      instrument script editor starts to become an
      <i title="<b>Integrated Development Environment</b>: A software application that provides comprehensive facilities for software development.">
        IDE
      </i>
      for instrument script development.

    <h3>Syntax Highlighting</h3>
    <p>
      Gigedit's integrated instrument script editor supports now tight coupling
      directly with LinuxSampler's actual instrument script parser backend.
      That provides several improvements for the script editor. For example
      colored syntax highlighting of scripts is now displayed appropriately and
      simply looks much better now. Previously there was some small hard coded
      script parser code on Gigedit's side which however was buggy and simply
      did no great job.
    </p>

    <h3>Error Reporting</h3>
    <p>
      Another major improvement possible due to the direct coupling with LinuxSampler's
      script backend, is support for showing all issues related to the script (errors
      and warnings) directly within the script editor in real-time while you are
      typing. The actual erroneous locations of the script are automatically
      highlighted with red background color, locations of the script with
      warnings are automatically highlighted with yellow background color, and
      when you move your mouse over the respective code location, the precise
      error/warning message is displayed as a tooltip. And last but not least
      there is a summary of issues displayed in the status bar of the script
      editor. Since LinuxSampler's instrument script backend is actually doing
      all the work for the script editor, all aspects of the language, all
      details about built-in functions and variables, and all potential issues
      with their precise cause and messages are automatically covered by the
      script editor.
      That way you immediately know whether or whether not your script
      is OK with every character you are typing, and without requiring to
      actually load the script with an instrument into the sampler.
    </p>

    <h3>Live Development</h3>
    <p>
      Previously, when you made any changes to scripts, you had to manually
      tell the sampler to reload the respective instrument to actually being
      able to try out your changes and play it with some sound. This is not
      needed anymore. You can now simply open the respective script of the
      sound you are currently playing with, change the script with Gigedit's
      integrated script editor and click either on the "Apply" button or use
      the Ctrl-S keyboard shortcut. The sampler will immediately reload the
      script and the new version of your script will immediately become audible
      with the sampler. That makes working on scripts much faster and convenient.

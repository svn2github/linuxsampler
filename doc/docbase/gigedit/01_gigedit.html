      Gigedit is a graphical instrument editor for
      <i title="A digital audio recording of some sonic source.">sample</i>
      based virtual instruments, based on the GigaStudio/Gigasampler file format.
      The GigaStudio/Gigasampler (.gig) file format is one of the major sampler
      formats supported by LinuxSampler and hence you can use Gigedit both
      as stand-alone instrument editor, or in conjunction with LinuxSampler for 
      editing such instruments "live" while playing them with the sampler.

    <note>
      This documentation is currently in a transition phase. The old Gigedit
      manual will move to this location, however this process has not been
      completed yet. You may want to refer to the
      <a href="http://www.linuxsampler.org/documentation.html">old Gigedit manual</a>
      in the meantime.

      <a href="gigedit_scripts.html">managing real-time instrument scripts</a>
      with Gigedit.

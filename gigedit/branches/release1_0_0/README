Gigedit
=======

Gigedit is an instrument editor for gig files. Gig files are
used by software samplers such as LinuxSampler and GigaStudio.

With gigedit it is possible to modify existing gig files and also to
create completely new instruments from scratch. Gigedit can be run as
a stand-alone application, or as a plugin to LinuxSampler.

Please note that this is an early version that only includes the most
basic features needed to create and edit gig files. There is still a
lot to do, fix and improve.

Be sure to backup your original gig files before editing them in
gigedit.

The latest version of gigedit can be found at:

http://www.linuxsampler.org

Questions, bug reports and suggestions can be sent to LinuxSampler
developer's mailing list:

linuxsampler-devel@lists.sourceforge.net


License
=======

Gigedit is licensed under the GNU General Public License. See the file
COPYING for details.


Requirements
============

Gigedit requires gtkmm, libgig and libsndfile libraries. There is an
optional dependency to LinuxSampler, for being able to play
instruments while editing. Also optional is the dependency to gettext
for internationalization support.


Installation
============

On a POSIX system like Linux or OSX you should only have to call the
following on the console:

./configure
make
su -c "make install"

See the file INSTALL for details about these steps and options.

Windows users shall read the respective README file in the "win32"
directory for compilation instructions.


Building from CVS
=================

./autogen.sh
./configure
make
su -c "make install"


Internationalization: Help on Translations !
============================================

You want to help us translating gigedit into a language you speak? Good!
This is how it works:

    Updating an existing translation (at the moment only Swedish and German):
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------

    First collect all text from gigedit's current C++ source code, by typing
    the following:

    cd po
    make update-po

    The language source files (de.po, sv.po, ...) are now updated and you may
    open one of it now either with a text editor of your choice or better: by
    using the graphical translation tool "poedit":

    poedit de.po


    Add a new translation (for another language not yet supported):
    ---------------------------------------------------------------

    First collect all text from gigedit's current C++ source code, by typing
    the following:

    cd po
    make update-po

    There should now be a yet untranslated file "gigedit.pot". Rename it to
    to the language you want to translate, i.e.:

    mv gigedit.pot ru.po

    Now either open the file ("ru.po") with a text editor of your choice or
    better: by using the graphical translation tool "poedit":

    poedit ru.po

After you are done with translating the language file, please send it to us!

Gigedit is an editor for gig files. Gig files contain sampled
instruments and are used by software samplers such as LinuxSampler and
GigaStudio.

Note that this is an alpha version with a lot of functionality
missing. It is currently not possible to create new instruments,
regions and dimensions, which means that a new gig file cannot be
created from scratch. Existing gig files can however be loaded,
examined and parameters inside the dimension regions can be modified.

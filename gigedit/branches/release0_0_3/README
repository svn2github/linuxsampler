Gigedit
=======

Gigedit is an instrument editor for gig files. Gig files are
used by software samplers such as LinuxSampler and GigaStudio.

With gigedit it is possible to modify existing gig files and also to
create completely new instruments from scratch.

Please note that this is an alpha version that only includes the most
basic features needed to create and edit gig files. There is still a
lot to do, fix and improve.

Be sure to backup your original gig files before editing them in
gigedit.

The latest version of gigedit can be found at:

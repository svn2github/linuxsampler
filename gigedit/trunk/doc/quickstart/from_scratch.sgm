  <para>
	Now you have <productname>gigedit</productname> running and can see
	something like the following screenshot. On the left you see an
	empty white field, on the right a set of tabbed dialogs and below
	all that some piano keys. At this early stage everything is disabled,
	except the topmost menu.
  </para>

  </figure>

  <para>
	In the next paragraphs you will add a few samples and stuff to create
	a totally new GIG file. If you're interested in some technical background
	and help on the terms used here, refere to <xref linkend="gig" />.
  </para>

 <section id="start_region"><title>Creating a Region</title>
  <para>
	To start with a new file, we need a new file. Choose
	<menuchoice>
	 <guimenu>File</guimenu>
	 <guimenuitem>New</guimenuitem>
	</menuchoice>
	and the only thing changing is an entry <emphasis>Default Group</emphasis>
	on the previously white field on the left.
  </para>

	<imagedata fileref="shot_default_group.png" format="PNG"/>
	</imageobject></mediaobject></screenshot>
  </figure>

  <para>
	Now there's a lot more possible on the gui and lacking such a fine
	quickstart I had to figure it out myself: Right click somewhere
	in the gray area above the piano keys. There's a small gray band
	and you'll get the following popup menu (Says: <emphasis>Add</emphasis>,
	the red arrows mark the area's width where you can cause this
	popup to pop up):

  <figure id="shot_new_dimension"><title>Screenshot of the new dimension action</title>
	<screenshot><mediaobject><imageobject>
	<imagedata fileref="shot_new_dimension.png" format="PNG"/>
	</imageobject></mediaobject></screenshot>
  </figure>

  <para>
	If you click this action a small rectangle occurs and some of the input
	fields and sliders on the tab <emphasis>EG1</emphasis> are enabled. By
	moving the curser above the rectangle's left and right border you can
	resize it and define the region's width, e.g. it's lowest and highest
	key. Now you have a region and all you need is a sample, to play
	when pressing the region's keys.
  </para>
  <tip><simpara>
	Until the alpha version it was necessary to do it that way around
	instead of first adding a sample and then a region. It caused some
	additional dimensions to show up, which could not be removed.
  </simpara></tip>

 <section id="start_sample"><title>Adding a sample</title>
  <para>
	Hopefully you have some WAV samples somewhere available on
	your computer. If not: get some from your microphone, the
	internet or a friend who knows, what a WAV is ;-). Select
	the entry <guimenuitem>Default Group</guimenuitem> on the left
	and right click it (or right click it twice, so that <guimenuitem>
	Add Sample(s)</guimenuitem> is enabled). And click
	<guimenuitem>Add Sample(s)</guimenuitem>. Browse with the
	file chooser through your harddisk and select a wav sample.
	If you did so, your Default Group will look like this (maybe
	you need to open the tree like structure by clicking the
	triangle in front).
  </para>
  
  <figure id="shot_add_sample"><title>Screenshot after adding the sample</title>
	<screenshot><mediaobject><imageobject>
	<imagedata fileref="shot_add_sample.png" format="PNG"/>
	</imageobject></mediaobject></screenshot>
  </figure>

  <para>
	On the left you see the popup menu, the added sample below, on the
	right side the enabled input elements and below all that the
	piano key roll with a blueish rectangle from C2 to C3. The
	input field <emphasis>Sample</emphasis> says <code>NULL</code>.
	That means our region has no sample assigned. I tried to enter
	the sample's name, but that did not work. Drag and Drop is
	the key: Drag the added sample onto the input field
	<emphasis>Sample</emphasis> and the cursor changes. Drop
	it and you'll see the name inside the field.
  </para>

 <section id="start_where_to_go"><title>Where to go from here?</title>
  <para>
	Weeeee, no you can save your changes with <guimenuitem>Save As</guimenuitem>.
	When I wrote this quickstart the <guimenuitem>Save</guimenuitem> action
	did not show a file name dialog but an error. So save it and
	play with it. Load it into your sampler, perferrably
	<productname>LinuxSampler</productname> and hit the keys. But only
	in the region's range you'll here some noise...your sample.
  </para>
  <para>
	If it did not work: check your equipment, hard- and software, maybe
	use some tools like <command>gigdump</command> or <command>gigextract</command>
	to verify, that the sample(s) are inside the gig file and it's structure
	is correct. Otherwise join the <productname>LinuxSampler</productname>'s
	mailing list (<ulink url="http://www.linuxsampler.org/developers.html" />).

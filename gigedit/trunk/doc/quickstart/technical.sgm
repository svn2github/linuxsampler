	Now that you've tried enough you want to know what all
	the funny elements like <emphasis>Attack</emphasis> or
	<emphasis>LFO</emphasis> mean. I don't need to explain
	it here, look up the terms in a textbook. If you can
	explain the difference between <emphasis>Amplifier</emphasis>
	(Amp) and <emphasis>Voltage Controlled Filter</emphasis>
	(VCF) you can go on looking on the next picture:

 <para>
	As you can see you have access to an Amp and one VCF. This
	is not much from a synthesizer's point of view, but enough if
	your samples are already perfectly synthesized. Gigedit provides
	for 4 tabs, one for each section (Amp/VCF) and one for the
	LFO and the ADSR.

  <para>
   <indexterm>
    <primary>Sample Bank</primary>
   </indexterm>
	First sampler use was just repeating a sound, a drum
	sample, some vocals, maybe short snippets of whole
	orchestrations. This so called <firstterm>Sample Bank</firstterm>
	is a collection of samples, vocals, or sounds that will
	never be stretched along a key range. You simply press
	a key and the sound occurs as it is. So there won't be
	no LFO nor ADSR influence. Regions will range only for one
	key, maybe include the half tone, maybe not. For drum
	maps I personally recommend the <xref linkend="gen_midi_drum"/>.
	If you have different drum sets you may switch easily
	between them without reprogramming your sequencer. Also
	shifting by octaves is easy to change the drums.

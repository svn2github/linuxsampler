Version 0.1.0 (2007-10-15)

  Many fixes have been made to make sure that the gig files created by
  gigedit are working properly in LinuxSampler and GigaStudio. Gigedit
  can now be run as a LinuxSampler plugin, allowing live editing of
  loaded instruments. Sample loop parameters and instrument global
  properties can now be edited. 24 bit samples can be imported. A
  quick-start document has been added. Lots of other minor fixes and
  improvements have been done.

Version 0.0.3 (2007-03-24)

  First version of gigedit. The program is renamed from gigview to
  gigedit as it is now an editor, not just a viewer. Basic support for
  both editing existing gig files and creating new ones from scratch
  is provided.

Version 0.0.2 (2006-11-05)

  Quick fix for a thread initialization problem.

Version 0.0.1 (2006-11-05)

  First version of gigview.

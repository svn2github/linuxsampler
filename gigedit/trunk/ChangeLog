    logical and intuitive order

  * use normal layout for checkboxes

    binary is now just calling that shared library
  * implemented an "instrument editor plugin" for LinuxSampler to allow
    on-the-fly instrument editing within the sampler's own process
    (revised directories to a more automake-friendly structure for this, to
    avoid compilation and install errors)

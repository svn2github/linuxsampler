Version SVN HEAD (?)

  * allow building with G/GDK/GTK_DISABLE_DEPRECATED
  * fixed building without linuxsampler on Mac
  * fixed some compiler and cppcheck warnings
  * avoid using gtk stock items, as they are deprecated in gtk 3.10
  * synthesis paremeter page tabs are now scrollable (fixes an issue with
    GTK 3: default theme uses huge tabs which breaks the overall layout on
    average window sizes)
  * Automake: set environment variable GCC_COLORS=auto to allow GCC to
    auto detect whether it (sh/c)ould output its messages in color.
  * NKSP Editor: Added support for liblinuxsampler's NKSP syntax
    highlighting backend.
  * Script Editor: Some color tweaks (using now same text colors as on
    the NKSP refrence documentation website).
  * Script Editor: Added support for liblinuxsampler's NKSP parser
    backend for displaying parser errors and warnings directly within
    the source code.

Version 1.0.0 (2015-07-17)

  * minor fix in configure for cross-compiling
  * minor Makefile fix for parallel make
  * use Cairo instead of deprecated gdk drawing primitives
  * avoid deprecated gtk methods when using newer gtk versions
  * raised minimum supported gtkmm version to 2.8
  * ported to gtkmm 3, keeping compatibility with gtkmm 2
  * gtkmm 3 fix: rewrote the custom widgets (regionchooser and
    dimregionchooser) so they only draw pixels in the on_draw
    method. This should make them work again in newer gtkmm 3
    environments.
  * added support for new glibmm threads API
  * gtkmm 3 fix: the WrapLabel custom widget is not needed in gtkmm 3
  * fixed building on Debian testing (#186)
  * modernized configure script
  * added graphical curves for velocity response and crossfade
  * added "Duplicate Instrument" function
  * fixed import of 32 bit float wav files
  * code refactoring: created a PropEdit class for property editor
    windows, moved Table class from mainwindow to paramedit
  * minor gui tweaks: made note entry fields a bit wider, set a
    minimum width for scales
  * bug fix: avoid stale information in the instrument properties
    window when a new file is loaded or the instrument is removed
  * cross fade graph: draw curves of all layers in the same graph
  * made sure the instruments menu is updated when instruments are
    added, removed or renamed
  * fixed name entry field in instrument properties window
  * use character encoding Windows-1252 for all strings in gig files
  * show dimension zone start and end as numeric text labels
  * copying sample informations automatically may now be disabled from the
    new "Edit" main menu
  * import 'fine tune' when importing samples with libsndfile
  * Mac OS X: initialize gtk and gettext with files from base
    directory of the libgigedit library
  * Mac OS X: fixed "recently used" in file dialogs
  * Mac OS X: avoid crash when starting gigedit as an application
    bundle
  * Mac OS X: try to launch the GUI on the process's "main" thread
  * show build date and libgig version number in about dialog
  * added dialog for editing the CtrlTrigger and Legato midi rules
  * if there is no region yet, show a red hint text to the user that he may
    right click on the region chooser area to add a region
  * added tooltips to main menu entries (was buggy before)
  * added tooltips to instruments tree view and samples tree view
  * added various tooltips and adjusted some labels on the region settings
    pane
  * GIG SOUND FORMAT EXTENSION: only a small set of possible MIDI controllers
    was selectable for EG1 controller, EG2 controller and attenuation
    controller (and no CC number was shown in the combo box). Obviously the
    additional MIDI controllers can only be used with LinuxSampler, they would
    not work with Gigasampler/GigaStudio. A warning message will be shown
    though whenever somebody tries to use one of those extension controllers.
  * Combine instruments: a new feature that allows to merge a selection of
    instruments to one new single instrument. It uses the 'layer' dimension
    to stack up the instruments. This feature is available from the main menu
    under 'Tools' -> 'Combine Instruments'.
  * Dimension zone amount: Support for increasing and decreasing the amount of
    dimension zones by right clicking on the respective zone and either
    selecting "delete" or "split" in the popup menu.
  * Combine instruments: generalized this tool to allow combining instruments
    based on any dimension, not only the 'layer' dimension.
  * 'Dimension Manager' dialog: show dialog window with at least 460x300px on
    initial usage (was far too small by default).
  * File Property Dialog: allow viewing and altering the Giga file format
    version (by combo box).
  * 'Dimension Manager' dialog: added support for viewing and editing
    dimensions of all regions simultaniously.
  * GIG SOUND FORMAT EXTENSION: Added support for managing and editing
    real-time instrument scripts. Instrument scripts are a LinuxSampler
    extension of the original Giga format and will not load with the
    GigaStudio software.
  * GIG SOUND FORMAT EXTENSION: Added support for managing script slots for
    instruments. Script slots define which scripts shall be executed for an
    instrument by the sampler and in which order.
  * Samples tree view on main window: display the amount of references for
    each sample and show the respective sample in gray color in case it is not
    referenced at all.
  * Samples tree view: implemented sample reference browser, which shows a
    tree with all instruments and their respective regions which reference the
    selected sample once ore more.
  * Restructured main menu: duplicated all popup menus to the main menu,
    automatically switch to the right tree view tab when either selecting the
    "Sample", "Instrument" or "Script" main menu entry.
  * Dimension Region Selector: implemented multi zone selection by press and
    hold CTRL key.
  * Dimension Region Selector: show bottom and upper limit values for all
    dimension zones, not just the currently selected ones.
  * Dimension Region Selector: Fixed drawing issues when zone sizes were
    altered by mouse drag and labels being displayed at wrong positions.
  * Region Chooser: Double click opens dimension manager dialog.
  * Dimension Manager: Clicking on dimension type cell of an existing dimension
    opens a popup to alter the dimension type.
  * Script Tree: Double click opens script editor.
  * Fixed potential crash if exception was thrown while opening a gig file.
  * Added support for visual progress bar while saving a gig file.
  * Automatically switch the sampler's (audible) instrument whenever another
    instrument was selected in gigedit (this default behavior can be switched
    off in the settings menu of gigedit).
  * Dimension Region Editor: Show coarse sample format info (audio channels,
    bit depth, sample rate) and unique sample ID (since the gig format allows
    different samples to have the same name).
  * Dimension Region Editor: Added button "Select Sample" on the sample tab,
    which allows to conveniently select the dimension region's sample on the
    left hand side's samples tree view.
  * Sample Referenve View Dialog: Clicking on a reference in the list closes
    the dialog and jumps directly to the respective instrument, region and
    dimension region the respective sample reference is located at.
  * Fixed instruments, samples and scripts to appear twice after save.
  * Implemented reordering of instruments by drag & drop.
  * Implemented replacing of existing samples.
  * Added "X" button next to sample reference field, which allows to remove
    the current sample reference, allowing to create a "silent case" where
    no sample shall be played.
  * Fixed file name disappearing from title bar on certain actions.
  * Added new menu item "View"->"Refresh All".
  * Added new menu item "Samples"->"Remove Unused Samples".
  * Region Chooser: when moving a region around automatically move the
    keyboard position dependent pitch accordingly (can be turned off with
    "Settings"->"Move root key with region moved").

    (selectable by combobox below the keyboard)
  * show absolute velocity value of note-on & note-off events below
    the virtual MIDI keyboard
  * renamed misleading names regarding the gig format's "keyswitching"
    feature (the dimension is now displayed as "keyswitching" instead of
    "keyboard" in the dimregchooser widget and the two parameters for
    defining the actual keyswitching area on the keyboard in the instruments
    properties dialog are now called "Keyswitching range low/high" instead of
    "Dimension key range low/high")

Version CVS HEAD (?)
  * minor fix in configure for cross-compiling
  * minor Makefile fix for parallel make
  * use Cairo instead of deprecated gdk drawing primitives
  * avoid deprecated gtk methods when using newer gtk versions
  * raised minimum supported gtkmm version to 2.8
  * ported to gtkmm 3, keeping compatibility with gtkmm 2
  * gtkmm 3 fix: rewrote the custom widgets (regionchooser and
    dimregionchooser) so they only draw pixels in the on_draw
    method. This should make them work again in newer gtkmm 3
    environments.
  * added support for new glibmm threads API
  * gtkmm 3 fix: the WrapLabel custom widget is not needed in gtkmm 3
  * fixed building on Debian testing (#186)
  * modernized configure script
  * added graphical curves for velocity response and crossfade

Version 0.2.0 (2009-07-31)

  * fixed file properties dialog - properties now can be edited
  * gig files where regions are not internally ordered are now handled
  * the resize mouse pointer is not shown anymore for regions that
    can't be resized
  * the region and dimregion chooser widgets are now resizable
  * bugfix: sometimes you could not delete more than one dimension
  * filter headers are now also greyed out when the filter is inactive
  * autoconf fix: LS plugin dirs with digits in their prefix
    (e.g. "/usr/lib64/foo") are now resolved in relative dirs as well
    (show a warning when resolving the relative path failed)
  * keys on the virtual keyboard now highlight on note on events on
    sampler side
  * virtual keyboard can now trigger notes for the sampler (only in
    live-mode of course)
  * implemented alternative behavior for the virtual MIDI keyboard
    (selectable by combobox below the keyboard)
  * show absolute velocity value of note-on & note-off events below
    the virtual MIDI keyboard
  * renamed misleading names regarding the gig format's "keyswitching"
    feature (the dimension is now displayed as "keyswitching" instead of
    "keyboard" in the dimregchooser widget and the two parameters for
    defining the actual keyswitching area on the keyboard in the instruments
    properties dialog are now called "Keyswitching range low/high" instead of
    "Dimension key range low/high")
  * added "replace all samples" function to samples popup menu
    (patch by Anders Dahnielson, a bit extended, fixes #73)
  * bugfix: dimension manager window didn't update when another region
    was selected (#78)
  * in "Save As..." dialog set inital filename to "copy_of_<filename>" and
    show a warning message that saving to the same .gig file will corrupt
    the sample wave data
  * fixed compilation with gcc 4.3
  * the "Add Samples" dialog now remembers current directory (patch by
    Devin Anderson, fixes #81)
  * it is now possible to create dimensions where the amount of zones
    isn't a power of two (patch by Devin Anderson, #89, slightly
    modified)
  * fixed configure check for libsndfile loop support
  * bugfix: when a stereo sample is replaced, make sure both zones of
    the sample channel dimension get updated with the new sample
  * minor gui fix: made multi line lables expand to use full width
  * fixes for building the plugin with MinGW
  * added rpm packaging file
    (patch by Devin Anderson, slightly modified, fixes #88)
  * made all visible strings translatable
  * bugfix: inform the sampler when new file(s) has been imported on save
    operation (#82)
  * updated LinuxSampler plugin of gigedit to the latest liblinuxsampler
    C++ API changes
  * Windows: look for translations using base directory of libgigedit
    dll
  * virtual keyboard fixes: restore to grey when outside keyboard.
    Don't trigger multiple notes for each key when moving mouse.

Version 0.1.1 (2007-12-06)

  * multiple editor windows can now be opened by the plugin
  * bugfix: gigedit didn't start on windows 2000
  * standard gtk command line parameters is now handled
  * parameter edits can now be applied to multiple regions and
    dimension regions simultaneously - three checkboxes were added
    that select if changes apply to all regions and/or all dimension
    regions

Version 0.1.0 (2007-10-15)

  * fixed compilation with older gcc versions
  * added German translation
  * reworked instrument properties dialog - properties can now be
    edited
  * restructured dimension region editor for elements to be in a more
    logical and intuitive order
  * added Makefile.cvs (just for standard compliance with other projects)
  * added Debian packaging infrastructure
  * implemented sample loop editing
  * improved labels in dimension region editor
  * use normal layout for checkboxes
  * allow to resize dimension zones even when the respective dimension has
    no custom dimension splits yet
  * moved instrument editor into a shared library 'libgigedit', the 'gigedit'
    binary is now just calling that shared library
  * implemented an "instrument editor plugin" for LinuxSampler to allow
    on-the-fly instrument editing within the sampler's own process
    (revised directories to a more automake-friendly structure for this, to
    avoid compilation and install errors)
  * added experimental support to synchronize gigedit with LinuxSampler to
    avoid race conditions / crash while modifying data structures
  * added quick start documentation by Alexander Methke
  * a changed file is now marked with an asterisk in the window title
  * added close confirmation dialog, shown if file is changed
  * "save" means "save as" for new files
  * enabled acceleration keys
  * add .gig to filename in "save as" if it's not already there
  * filename character encodings other than utf-8 supported
  * regions can now be moved, not just resized
  * improved labels in instrument properties dialog
  * remove file extensions from file names when importing samples
  * added digits for octave numbers on the keyboard and made keys
    outside piano range grey
  * added support for 24 bit sample import
  * when importing samples, settings for loops and root note are
    copied from the sample files (if they have such settings)
  * start with a new gig file by default
  * make sure samplechannel dimension gets created for stereo samples
  * allow building with older versions of gtk and libsndfile
  * remember selected dimension when switching regions
  * check if file is savable before trying to save

    right shows whether gigedit is running stand-alone or attached to
    LinuxSampler)

  * first release of gigedit

Version 0.1.1 (2007-12-06)

  * multiple editor windows can now be opened by the plugin
  * bugfix: gigedit didn't start on windows 2000
  * standard gtk command line parameters is now handled
  * parameter edits can now be applied to multiple regions and
    dimension regions simultaneously - three checkboxes were added
    that select if changes apply to all regions and/or all dimension
    regions

Version 0.1.0 (2007-10-15)

  * fixed compilation with older gcc versions
  * added German translation
  * reworked instrument properties dialog - properties can now be
    edited
  * restructured dimension region editor for elements to be in a more
    logical and intuitive order
  * added Makefile.cvs (just for standard compliance with other projects)
  * added Debian packaging infrastructure
  * implemented sample loop editing
  * improved labels in dimension region editor
  * use normal layout for checkboxes
  * allow to resize dimension zones even when the respective dimension has
    no custom dimension splits yet
  * moved instrument editor into a shared library 'libgigedit', the 'gigedit'
    binary is now just calling that shared library
  * implemented an "instrument editor plugin" for LinuxSampler to allow
    on-the-fly instrument editing within the sampler's own process
    (revised directories to a more automake-friendly structure for this, to
    avoid compilation and install errors)
  * added experimental support to synchronize gigedit with LinuxSampler to
    avoid race conditions / crash while modifying data structures
  * added quick start documentation by Alexander Methke
  * a changed file is now marked with an asterisk in the window title
  * added close confirmation dialog, shown if file is changed
  * "save" means "save as" for new files
  * enabled acceleration keys
  * add .gig to filename in "save as" if it's not already there
  * filename character encodings other than utf-8 supported
  * regions can now be moved, not just resized
  * improved labels in instrument properties dialog
  * remove file extensions from file names when importing samples
  * added digits for octave numbers on the keyboard and made keys
    outside piano range grey
  * added support for 24 bit sample import
  * when importing samples, settings for loops and root note are
    copied from the sample files (if they have such settings)
  * start with a new gig file by default
  * make sure samplechannel dimension gets created for stereo samples
  * allow building with older versions of gtk and libsndfile
  * remember selected dimension when switching regions
  * check if file is savable before trying to save
  * gettext is now an optional dependency
  * added Dev-C++ project files for Windows systems
  * added status bar to the bottom of main window (independent area on the
    right shows whether gigedit is running stand-alone or attached to
    LinuxSampler)
  * fixed crash when gigedit was compiled with CXXFLAGS="-g"

Version 0.0.3 (2007-03-24)

  * first release of gigedit

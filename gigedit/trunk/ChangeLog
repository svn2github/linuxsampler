Version CVS HEAD

    logical and intuitive order

    binary is now just calling that shared library
  * implemented an "instrument editor plugin" for LinuxSampler to allow

    avoid compilation and install errors)

  * added close confirmation dialog, shown if file is changed
  * "save" means "save as" for new files

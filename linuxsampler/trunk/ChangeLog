Version 0.5.0 (15 October 2007)

  * packaging changes:
    - config.h is not going to be installed along with liblinuxsampler's
      API header files anymore
    - only the API relevant header (and source) files will be exported to
      the Doxygen API documentation (explicitly listed in Doxyfile.in)
    - added completely new XCode project files for Mac OSX which is now
      capable to execute our autoconf environment, thus no need anymore
      to maintain the compile time configuration file (osx/version.h) for
      OSX manually (patch by Toshi Nagata)
    - fixed buggy boolean --enable-foo / --disable-foo configure script
      parameters
    - global.h now only covers global definitions that are needed for the
      C++ API header files, all implementation internal global definitions
      are now in global_private.h
    - atomic.h is not exposed to the C++ API anymore
    - no need to include config.h anymore for using LS's API header files
    - fixed warnings in API doc generation

  * general changes:
    - replaced the old, confusing MIDI program change mechanism by a
      flexible MIDI instrument mapper which allows to map arbitrary
      (MIDI bank, MIDI program) pairs with arbitrary
      (engine type, instrument file, file index) triplets which will be
      loaded on the respective channel when such MIDI program change
      messages arrive, beside that, each entry allows to define a life-time
      strategy for the instrument, so the user can define whether the
      instrument should i.e. be permanently loaded (to be able to switch
      quickly among sounds) or i.e. loaded just on demand when the
      respective program change arrives (to safe RAM space), as well as a
      global volume factor for each entry, so the user can adjust the volume
      dynamic of his mapped instrument collection without having to modify
      the instrument files, also one can manage arbitrary amount of such
      MIDI instrument maps and assign each sampler channel individually
      a certain map, so that i.e. separation of normal instruments and
      drumkits is possible
    - new notification events for tracking changes to audio/MIDI devices,
      MIDI instrument maps, MIDI instruments, FX sends, global volume.
    - sampler was limited to load max. 200 instruments in the background
      due to a constant size RingBuffer FIFO which is now replaced by a
      dynamic (unlimited) size std::list FIFO
    - added FX sends, these allow to route audio signals to arbitrary audio
      output channels for being processed by external effect processors
      (i.e. jack-rack), the send levels are controllable via arbitrary MIDI
      controllers
    - global (sampler wide) volume can now be controlled at runtime
    - Implemented new, improved notification system
    - fixed compilation errors regarding OSX
      (patch by Toshi Nagata)
    - implemented instruments database
    - added support for escape sequences to the instruments database
    - added highly experimental support for on-the-fly instrument editing
      within the sampler's process (by using instrument editor plugins),
      you'll notice the new "Registered instrument editors:" message on
      startup, added a new LSCP command:
      "EDIT CHANNEL INSTRUMENT <sampler-channel>"
      to spawn a matching instrument editor for the instrument on the
      given sampler channel, the plugin path can be overridden at compile
      time with ./configure --enable-plugin-dir=/some/dir
    - added experimental code for synchronizing instrument editors hosted
      in the sampler's process to safely edit instruments while playing
      without a crash (hopefully) by either suspending single regions
      wherever possible or if unavoidable whole engine(s)
    - fixed several issues in fundamental "Thread" class: set scheduling
      policy and priority on thread level, set a minimum stack size for
      thread (TODO: a reasonable value yet to be tested), bugfix: non-RT
      threads simply inherited properties of starting thread instead of
      setting their own policy and priority
    - minor fix in our automatic stack trace mechanism on crashes, the
      main process did not wait for the stack trace process to finish
      its output
    - fixed some minor memory leaks
    - reenabled assembly features support, at the moment only for
      enabling a fast denormal FPU mode (x86 platforms supporting SSE2)
    - minor assembly fix in x86 features detection (don't use the PIC
      register, to avoid relocations in the text segment at runtime)
    - POSIX callback functions of Thread.h are hidden

  * MIDI driver:
    - dispatch bank select (MSB and LSB) messages

  * audio driver:
    - the ALSA audio output driver parameters now reflect the correct
      parameter value ranges for the respective selected sound card
      (patch by Till Wimmer, a bit fixed and extended)

  * Gigasampler format engine:
    - if a filter is used and EG2 finishes before EG1, let the voice
      die when EG2 has finished (this fixes a problem with clicks and
      voice starvation for some gigs)
    - playback is no longer disabled during instrument loading
    - all notes playing on a channel that changes its instrument keep
      playing with the old instrument until they get a note off
      command
    - EG fix: a release value of zero could cause noises or crash
    - handle MIDI coarse tuning messages (MIDI RPN #0 MSB #2 LSB)
    - EG fine tuning: when attack is zero the EG starts at a level
      above max sustain level, which means that there is a decay phase
      even if sustain is 100%
    - more EG fixes: the level could sometimes go below zero and cause
      noises or crashes
    - minor fix of EGDecay (patch by Toshi Nagata)
    - fixed compiler error when --enable-override-filter-type was
      supplied to the configure script (fixes #46)
    - disk thread: queue sizes are now proportional to CONFIG_MAX_STREAMS
      instead of a fix value
    - behavior fix: on MIDI CC# 65 (portamento on / off), 126 (mono mode),
      127 (solo mode) only kill voices if the respective mode really
      changed

  * LSCP server:
    - fixed compile time error for old Bison versions
      (i.e. v1.28 found on MacOS 10.4, patch by Toshi Nagata)
    - parser now supports extended ASCII character set
      (up to ASCII code 255, i.e. includes now umlauts and accents)
    - filename arguments in LSCP commands now allow to use escape
      sequences, that is directly literal as one of: \', \", \\, \n, \r,
      \f, \t, \v, or as octal ASCII code value like \132, or as hex ASCII
      code value like \xf2) (fixes bug #24)
    - the following LSCP commands now also support escape sequences for at
      least one of their text-based parameters (i.e. name, description):
      "ADD MIDI_INSTRUMENT_MAP", "MAP MIDI_INSTRUMENT",
      "SET MIDI_INSTRUMENT_MAP NAME", "SET FX_SEND NAME", "CREATE FX_SEND",
      "SET DB_INSTRUMENT_DIRECTORY NAME",
      "SET DB_INSTRUMENT_DIRECTORY DESCRIPTION", "SET DB_INSTRUMENT NAME",
      "SET DB_INSTRUMENT DESCRIPTION", "FIND DB_INSTRUMENTS",
      "FIND DB_INSTRUMENT_DIRECTORIES"
    - returns verbose syntax errors (line and column where syntax error
      occured, the unexpected character and the actually expected, possible
      character(s), the latter only if less than 5 possibilities)
    - made sure that LSCP syntax is not affected by gigedit locale
      settings
    - bugfix regarding strings parameter lists: all comma separated lists
      of strings were treated as being one string containing commas
      (fixes #57)

  * Bug fixes:
    - fixed crash occurring on certain LSCP scripts (Bug 39)
    - another thread safety fix for lscp "load engine" and "set
      channel audio output device"
    - fixed a crash which occurs when reassigning the same engine
      on a sampler channel with connected MIDI device
    - fixed a crash which occurs when changing the number of ports of a MIDI
      device connected to a sampler channel to number less then or equal
      to the index of the port to which the sampler channel is connected.
    - The previous bindings were not been disconnected when altering
      the ALSA_SEQ_BINDINGS parameter. Introduced a NONE keyword for
      unsubscribing from all bindings (e.g. ALSA_SEQ_BINDINGS=NONE).
    - The active stream/voice count statistic was incorrect.
    - notification events were not been sent for some sampler
      channel changes
    - added default min and max values to restrict the number of allowed
      audio output channels and MIDI input ports
    - the connection to the PCM interface is now closed when destroying
      an audio output device
    - files with slash in their path or filename could not be loaded

  * test cases:
    - updated and fixed (haven't been touched in a while)

Version 0.4.0 (24 November 2006)

  * packaging changes:
    - changed deprecated copyright attribute to license; added ldconfig
      to post-(un)install steps; added devel package for liblinuxsampler;
      to linuxsampler.spec (RPM)
    - install necessary development header files for allowing 3rd party
      applications to link against liblinuxsampler
    - liblinuxsampler's API documentation can be generated with 'make docs'
      (Doxygen required)
    - added benchmark to automatically detect the best triangle LFO
      implementation (currently either an integer math solution or a
      di-harmonic approximation), automatic detection can be overriden
      with --enable-signed-triang-algo=x and --enable-unsigned-triang-algo=x
      configure script argument though (mandatory for cross-compilation)
    - do not automatically pick optimized gcc flags if the user already
      provided some on his own (as CXXFLAGS)
    - added compile time option to disable processing of All-Notes-Off MIDI
      messages
    - added compile time options to allow disabling the various audio and
      MIDI drivers
    - fixed automatic GCC CPU switch detection on PPC
      (patch by Ebrahim Mayat)

  * Gigasampler format engine:
    - extensive synthesis optimization
      (reimplementation of EGs and LFO(s), removed synthesis parameter
      prerendering and the synthesis parameter matrix in general, splitting
      each audio fragment into subfragments now where each subfragment uses
      constant pitch and filter coefficients. The volume coefficient is
      linearly interpolated inside a subfragment, unless
      --disable-interpolate-volume is set.)
    - fine tuning of the EG modulation parameters
    - improved filter cutoff calculation by adding support for the
      following gig parameters: Cutoff freq (used when no cutoff
      controller is defined), Control invert, Minimum cutoff, Velocity
      curve and Velocity range. The keyboard tracking now scales
      cutoff frequency instead of resonance.
    - added support for gig parameter Resonance.
    - fixed bug in sysex handling (patch by Juan Linietsky)
    - added global volume attenuation of -9 dB (0.35f) to prevent clipping
      which can be overridden with --enable-global-attenuation
    - EG fixes: made the length of "attack hold" stage more
      accurate. Release stage can now start before attack stage
      ends. Cancel release didn't work when sustain was zero. Attack
      time now has a minimal value to prevent clicks.
    - fixed pitch changes larger than one octave
    - fixed EG3 (pitch envelope) synthesis which was neutral all the time
    - implemented portamento mode and solo mode (a.k.a 'mono mode'):
      all modes can be altered via standard GM messages, that is CC5 for
      altering portamento time, CC65 for enabling / disabling portamento
      mode, CC126 for enabling solo mode and CC127 for disabling solo mode
    - fine tuning of the curves for volume (CC7), pan (CC10 and gig
      parameter) and crossfade
    - added support for the "attenuation controller threshold" gig
      parameter
    - added smoothing of volume changes caused by control change
      messages
    - sample loop parameters are now taken from the DimensionRegion
      instead of the wave chunk
    - fixed keyswitching for v3 gigs with a number of keyswitch splits
      not equal to a power of two
    - reimplementation of the filter algorithm. The new filter is more
      accurate and supports all gig filter types, including bandreject
      and lowpass turbo.
    - real support for 24 bit samples - samples are not truncated to
      16 bits anymore
    - support for aftertouch (channel pressure, not polyphonic
      aftertouch)
    - LFO1 behaviour fixed (dampening from max volume instead of
      amplifying from 0)

  * LSCP server:
    - fixed application exit on broken pipe error (fixes bug #20)
    - fixed the notification messages delay due to lack of
      network activity (fixes bug #26)
    - fixed parser bug which occured on space(s) within device parameters
      (e.g. "SET AUDIO_OUTPUT_CHANNEL_PARAMETER 0 0 SOMEPARAM='foo bar'")

  * audio driver:
    - added aRts audio output driver (by no means RT safe)

  * MIDI driver:
    - fixed legacy sysex code which caused dispatching of MIDI SysEx
      messages several times instead of once
    - API extension for MIDI drivers which already supply exact time stamps
      for events (i.e. for offline rendering based MIDI drivers)
    - added checks for bad MIDI data

  * linuxsampler application:
    - show available sampler engine types on startup

  * general changes:
    - support for muting sampler channels and solo mode of the same, two new
      LSCP commands ("SET CHANNEL MUTE" and "SET CHANNEL SOLO") and two new
      fields ("MUTE" and "SOLO") for command "GET CHANNEL INFO" were
      introduced for this, the behavior is the same like on a mixer console
      (patch by Grigor Iliev, a bit adjusted). Also added configure option
      --enable-process-muted-channels which can be used to enable the
      processing of muted channels.
    - support for sostenuto pedal
    - support for monitoring the total number of active voices
      (new LSCP commands: GET TOTAL_VOICE_COUNT, GET TOTAL_VOICE_COUNT_MAX,
      SUBSCRIBE TOTAL_VOICE_COUNT, UNSUBSCRIBE TOTAL_VOICE_COUNT)
    - fixed some memory management errors
    - fixed some concurrency problems that could lead to crashes when
      LSCP commands were executed
    - fixed crash when instrument loading failed previously on the same
      sampler channel (fixes bug #36)

Version 0.3.3 (15 July 2005)

  * packaging changes:
    - fixed compilation with gcc 4.0

  * Gigasampler format engine:
    - LFO preprocessing was performed even though the respective LFO was
      disabled by the instrument patch (minor efficiency fix)
    - if period time of chosen audio device is too small (< MIN_RELEASE_TIME)
      for volume ramp downs in the same fragment (needed for current voice
      stealing implementation) then simply inform the user with a warning
      about possible click sounds and reduce the volume ramp down
      appropriately instead of cancelling the audio device connection

Version 0.3.2 (24 June 2005)

  * packaging changes:
    - updated autotools build files to compile on OS X
      (conditional compilation of CoreMIDI and MidiShare drivers)
    - hand-crafted assembly optimization code can be disabled with
      './configure --disable-asm' (definitely not recommended)
    - fixed 'make dist' rule to include all necessary files
    - require automake (>= 1.5) for 'make -f Makefile.cvs'
      (due to 'dist-bzip2' automake option)

  * Gigasampler format engine:
    - support for the gig parameters for "release velocity response" curves
    - fine tuning of the EGADSR envelope
    - volume of release triggered samples now depends on note-on velocity,
      note length and gig parameter "release trigger decay" instead of
      note-off velocity.
    - revised voice stealing
      (fixes crash and endless loop caused by voice stealing)
    - don't reset scale tuning on instrument or audio output device change
    - handle key group conflicts right at the beginning of each fragment
      instead of when the respective voice is actually launched
      (fixes undefined behavior if stolen voices belonged to a key group -
      this case was followed by a "killed voice survived" error message)
    - fixed minor issue with null/silence samples
      (those stole voices even though they don't need a voice at all which
      resulted in "voice stealing didn't work out" messages)
    - don't reset volume, pan, pitch and MIDI controller values on
      instrument or audio output device change

  * LSCP server:
    - fixed some crashes (patch by Grigor Iliev, fixes #19)
    - fixed LSCP event "CHANNEL_INFO" notification
      (e.g. did not notify on volume changes or MIDI program change events)

  * linuxsampler application:
    - added command line parameters --lscp-addr and --lscp-port to override
      default IP address and port of LSCP server

Version 0.3.1 (24 May 2005)

  * initial release

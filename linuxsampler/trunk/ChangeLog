Version CVS HEAD (?)

  * packaging changes:
    - install necessary development header files for allowing 3rd party
      applications to link against liblinuxsampler
    - liblinuxsampler's API documentation can be generated with 'make docs'
      (Doxygen required)
    - added benchmark to automatically detect the best triangle LFO
      implementation (currently either an integer math solution or a
      di-harmonic approximation), automatic detection can be overriden
      with --enable-signed-triang-algo=x and --enable-unsigned-triang-algo=x
      configure script argument though (mandatory for cross-compilation)
    - do not automatically pick optimized gcc flags if the user already
      provided some on his own (as CXXFLAGS)

  * Gigasampler format engine:
    - extensive synthesis optimization
      (reimplementation of EGs and LFO(s), removed synthesis parameter
      prerendering and the synthesis parameter matrix in general, splitting
      each audio fragment into subfragments now where each subfragment uses
      constant synthesis parameters - that is volume, pitch and filter
      coefficients)
    - fine tuning of the EG modulation parameters
    - improved filter cutoff calculation by adding support for the
      following gig parameters: Cutoff freq (used when no cutoff
      controller is defined), Control invert, Minimum cutoff, Velocity
      curve and Velocity range. The keyboard tracking now scales
      cutoff frequency instead of resonance.
    - filter fine tuning: calculation of cutoff frequency and
      bandwidth improved. Removed use of "BasicBPFilter". Changed
      bandpass filter from constant peak to constant skirt. Added
      support for gig parameter Resonance.
    - fixed bug in sysex handling (patch by Juan Linietsky)
    - added global volume attenuation of -9 dB (0.35f) to prevent clipping
      which can be overridden with --enable-global-attenuation
    - EG fixes: made the length of "attack hold" stage more
      accurate. Release stage can now start before attack stage
      ends. Cancel release didn't work when sustain was zero. Attack
      time now has a minimal value to prevent clicks.
    - fixed pitch changes larger than one octave
    - fixed EG3 (pitch envelope) synthesis which was neutral all the time
    - implemented portamento mode and solo mode (a.k.a 'mono mode'):
      all modes can be altered via standard GM messages, that is CC5 for
      altering portamento time, CC65 for enabling / disabling portamento
      mode, CC126 for enabling solo mode and CC127 for disabling solo mode

  * LSCP server:
    - fixed application exit on broken pipe error (fixes bug #20)
    - fixed the notification messages delay due to lack of
      network activity (fixes bug #26)
    - fixed parser bug which occured on space(s) within device parameters
      (e.g. "SET AUDIO_OUTPUT_CHANNEL_PARAMETER 0 0 SOMEPARAM='foo bar'")

  * MIDI driver:
    - fixed legacy sysex code which caused dispatching of MIDI SysEx
      messages several times instead of once

  * general changes:
    - support for muting sampler channels and solo mode of the same, two new
      LSCP commands ("SET CHANNEL MUTE" and "SET CHANNEL SOLO") and two new
      fields ("MUTE" and "SOLO") for command "GET CHANNEL INFO" were
      introduced for this, the behavior is the same like on a mixer console
      (patch by Grigor Iliev, a bit adjusted). Also added configure option
      --enable-process-muted-channels which can be used to enable the
      processing of muted channels.
    - support for sostenuto pedal
    - support for monitoring the total number of active voices
      (new LSCP commands: GET TOTAL_VOICE_COUNT, GET TOTAL_VOICE_COUNT_MAX,
      SUBSCRIBE TOTAL_VOICE_COUNT, UNSUBSCRIBE TOTAL_VOICE_COUNT)

Version 0.3.3 (15 July 2005)

  * packaging changes:
    - fixed compilation with gcc 4.0

  * Gigasampler format engine:
    - LFO preprocessing was performed even though the respective LFO was
      disabled by the instrument patch (minor efficiency fix)
    - if period time of chosen audio device is too small (< MIN_RELEASE_TIME)
      for volume ramp downs in the same fragment (needed for current voice
      stealing implementation) then simply inform the user with a warning
      about possible click sounds and reduce the volume ramp down
      appropriately instead of cancelling the audio device connection

Version 0.3.2 (24 June 2005)

  * packaging changes:
    - updated autotools build files to compile on OS X
      (conditional compilation of CoreMIDI and MidiShare drivers)
    - hand-crafted assembly optimization code can be disabled with
      './configure --disable-asm' (definitely not recommended)
    - fixed 'make dist' rule to include all necessary files
    - require automake (>= 1.5) for 'make -f Makefile.cvs'
      (due to 'dist-bzip2' automake option)

  * Gigasampler format engine:
    - support for the gig parameters for "release velocity response" curves
    - fine tuning of the EGADSR envelope
    - volume of release triggered samples now depends on note-on velocity,
      note length and gig parameter "release trigger decay" instead of
      note-off velocity.
    - revised voice stealing
      (fixes crash and endless loop caused by voice stealing)
    - don't reset scale tuning on instrument or audio output device change
    - handle key group conflicts right at the beginning of each fragment
      instead of when the respective voice is actually launched
      (fixes undefined behavior if stolen voices belonged to a key group -
      this case was followed by a "killed voice survived" error message)
    - fixed minor issue with null/silence samples
      (those stole voices even though they don't need a voice at all which
      resulted in "voice stealing didn't work out" messages)
    - don't reset volume, pan, pitch and MIDI controller values on
      instrument or audio output device change

  * LSCP server:
    - fixed some crashes (patch by Grigor Iliev, fixes #19)
    - fixed LSCP event "CHANNEL_INFO" notification
      (e.g. did not notify on volume changes or MIDI program change events)

  * linuxsampler application:
    - added command line parameters --lscp-addr and --lscp-port to override
      default IP address and port of LSCP server

Version 0.3.1 (24 May 2005)

  * initial release

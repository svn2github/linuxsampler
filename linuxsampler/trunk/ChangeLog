Version CVS HEAD (?)

  * packaging changes:
    - updated autotools build files to compile on OS X
      (conditional compilation of CoreMIDI and MidiShare drivers)
    - hand-crafted assembly optimization code can be disabled with
      './configure --disable-asm' (definitely not recommended)

  * Gigasampler format engine:
    - support for the gig parameters for "release velocity response" curves
    - fine tuning of the EGADSR envelope
    - volume of release triggered samples now depends on note-on velocity,
      note length and gig parameter "release trigger decay" instead of
      note-off velocity.
    - revised voice stealing (fixes crash caused by voice stealing)
    
  * LSCP server:
    - fixed some crashes (patch by Grigor Iliev, fixes #19)  

Version 0.3.1 (24 May 2005)

  * initial release

Version CVS HEAD (?)

  * Gigasampler format engine:
    - fine tuning of the EG modulation parameters

Version 0.3.3 (15 July 2005)

  * packaging changes:
    - fixed compilation with gcc 4.0

  * Gigasampler format engine:
    - LFO preprocessing was performed even though the respective LFO was
      disabled by the instrument patch (minor efficiency fix)
    - if period time of chosen audio device is too small (< MIN_RELEASE_TIME)
      for volume ramp downs in the same fragment (needed for current voice
      stealing implementation) then simply inform the user with a warning
      about possible click sounds and reduce the volume ramp down
      appropriately instead of cancelling the audio device connection

Version 0.3.2 (24 June 2005)

  * packaging changes:
    - updated autotools build files to compile on OS X
      (conditional compilation of CoreMIDI and MidiShare drivers)
    - hand-crafted assembly optimization code can be disabled with
      './configure --disable-asm' (definitely not recommended)
    - fixed 'make dist' rule to include all necessary files
    - require automake (>= 1.5) for 'make -f Makefile.cvs'
      (due to 'dist-bzip2' automake option)

  * Gigasampler format engine:
    - support for the gig parameters for "release velocity response" curves
    - fine tuning of the EGADSR envelope
    - volume of release triggered samples now depends on note-on velocity,
      note length and gig parameter "release trigger decay" instead of
      note-off velocity.
    - revised voice stealing
      (fixes crash and endless loop caused by voice stealing)
    - don't reset scale tuning on instrument or audio output device change
    - handle key group conflicts right at the beginning of each fragment
      instead of when the respective voice is actually launched
      (fixes undefined behavior if stolen voices belonged to a key group -
      this case was followed by a "killed voice survived" error message)
    - fixed minor issue with null/silence samples
      (those stole voices even though they don't need a voice at all which
      resulted in "voice stealing didn't work out" messages)
    - don't reset volume, pan, pitch and MIDI controller values on
      instrument or audio output device change

  * LSCP server:
    - fixed some crashes (patch by Grigor Iliev, fixes #19)
    - fixed LSCP event "CHANNEL_INFO" notification
      (e.g. did not notify on volume changes or MIDI program change events)

  * linuxsampler application:
    - added command line parameters --lscp-addr and --lscp-port to override
      default IP address and port of LSCP server

Version 0.3.1 (24 May 2005)

  * initial release

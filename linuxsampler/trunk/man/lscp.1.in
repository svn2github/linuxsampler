.SH NAME
lscp \- the LinuxSampler Control Protocol (LSCP) shell
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lscp
[OPTIONS]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The LSCP shell allows to control a running instance of
.BR linuxsampler (1)
from the command line. By default, the LSCP shell will assume LinuxSampler to
run on the local machine and accordingly will try to connect to LinuxSampler on
the local machine. You can however also connect to LinuxSampler instances
running on any another machine available on the network. Since LSCP is
essentially just a human readable text protocol, you can also control the
sampler simply by using
.BR telnet (1)
or
.BR netcat (1),
however since the LSCP shell is aware about the details of the LSCP protocol,
it has various advantages, i.e. it provides colored highlighting of correct,
incorrect and complete commands while typing them on the terminal.

You can find examples and detailed informations
about LinuxSampler's network protocol (LSCP) on

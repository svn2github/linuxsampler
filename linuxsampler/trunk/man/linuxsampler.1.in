.SH NAME
linuxsampler \- modular, streaming capable sampler
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B linuxsampler
[OPTIONS]
.SH DESCRIPTION
LinuxSampler is a modular, streaming capable sampler. The sampler is designed as
backend, that is server-like console application. You will need a frontend
application like QSampler or JSampler to control the sampler and manage sampler
sessions. Or you have to send LSCP commands manually to the sampler e.g. by
using telnet or netcat.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "--help"
Print command line help and exit.
.IP "--version"
Print version information and exit.
.IP "--profile"
This option is currently not supported anymore, since the respective
profiling code is currently broken. Original behavior:
Output benchmark messages on the console. This reflects the current
efficiency as abstract BogoVoice count which is something like a
theoretical limit of the amount of voices which can be rendered in the given
scenario. It does not include all aspects of the sampler, that's why this
value is usually higher than what you really can achieve on your box. Also
note that this value is as well dependant on what instrument patch you are
using and what you are playing.
For a compact synthesis core benchmark, independent from drivers and
instrument files, you might want to use the one coming with the sampler's
source files instead (directory "benchmarks" of the source files).
.IP "--no-tune"
Disable assembly optimizations. Usually the sampler will detect CPU specific
features like MMX and SSE at runtime and use an appropriate assembly
optimized code in that case. With that switch you can disable this feature
and force the sampler to skip the assembly optimizations at runtime.
.IP "--statistics"
Output voice and disk stream count periodically on the console.
.IP "--lscp-addr IPADDRESS"
Defines IP address on which the LSCP server should listen to (default: any).
.IP "--lscp-port NUMBER"
Defines TCP port on which the LSCP server should listen to (default: 8888).
.IP "--create-instruments-db FILE"
Creates a database file with the given filename which can be used by the
sampler's instruments database system to maintain the user's collection of
instrument libraries. When this argument is given, the sampler will just
create the instruments DB file and exit.
.IP "--instruments-db-location FILE"
Overrides the location of the database file, which the sampler shall use for
its instruments database system
(default: @config_default_instruments_db_file@).
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.IP "LINUXSAMPLER_PLUGIN_DIR"
Allows to override the directory where LinuxSampler shall look for instrument
editor plugins.
.IP "LADSPA_PATH"
Allows to override the directory where LinuxSampler shall look for LADSPA
effect plugins.

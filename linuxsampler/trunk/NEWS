Version 0.4.0 (24 November 2006)

  Finally a new release after a long development cycle. The sampler now has
  a completely revised synthesis core. Note that due to this, most of the
  assembly code became incompatible and is thus deactivated at compile
  time. So don't bother trying to activate the assembly option, it won't
  compile! That's not an issue though, because even without assembly, the
  new synthesis core is faster than the old one with assembly. The
  Gigasampler engine now has real support for 24 bit samples, that is they
  won't be truncated anymore, and finally supports all filter types of the
  Gigasampler format. A lot of effort has been put into making all filters
  under all parameters being as accurate as possible, compared to the
  original Gigasampler ones. Analogue to hardware mixers, sampler channels
  can now be muted and solo-ed and there is support for GM portamento and
  GM mono mode (single note per channel) as well as support for sostenuto
  pedal. Beside LSCP, third-party applications can now also link against
  liblinuxsampler directly (using the sampler's C++ API). Beside these,
  there have been of course a huge bunch of fixes and quality improvements.

Version 0.3.3 (15 July 2005)

  Another bug fix release. It solves one usability issue regarding small
  fragments / high sampling rates of audio drivers, fixes some compile time
  errors with GCC 4.0 and fixes a minor efficiency bug.

Version 0.3.2 (24 June 2005)

  This is more or less just a bug fix release. Beside a bunch of little
  fixes it solves a serious crash in conjunction with voice stealing and
  slightly improves Gigasampler format playback accuracy.

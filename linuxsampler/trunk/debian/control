Description: realtime audio sampler
 LinuxSampler is a work in progress. It's goal is to produce a free
 software audio sampler with professional grade features.
 .
 It offers disk streaming capability and supports the Gigasampler format
 which is currently considered to be the best sampler format in regards of
 possibilities and sound quality.
 .
 This package provides the backend of LinuxSampler, that is the sampler
 engine together with audio and MIDI drivers. LinuxSampler can be
 controlled via network interface which uses an ASCII based protocol called
 LSCP. You might consider to install a GUI frontend for LinuxSampler as
 well.

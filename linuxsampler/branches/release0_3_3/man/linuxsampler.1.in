.SH NAME
linuxsampler \- modular, streaming capable sampler
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B linuxsampler
[OPTIONS]
.SH DESCRIPTION
LinuxSampler is a modular, streaming capable sampler. The sampler is designed as
backend, that is server-like console application. You will need a frontend
application like QSampler to control the sampler and manage sampler sessions. Or
you have to send LSCP commands manually to the sampler e.g. by using telnet or
netcat.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP \ --help
Print command line help and exit.
.TP
.IP \ --version
Print version and exit.
.TP
.IP \ --profile
Output benchmark messages on the console. This reflects the current
efficiency as abstract BogoVoice count which is something like a
theoretical limit of the amount of voices which can be rendered in the given
scenario. It does not include all aspects of the sampler, that's why this
value is usually higher than what you really can achieve on your box. Also
note that this value is as well dependant on what instrument patch you are
using and what you are playing.
.TP
.IP \ --no-tune
Disable assembly optimizations. Usually the sampler will detect CPU specific
features like MMX and SSE at runtime and use an appropriate assembly
optimized code in that case. With that switch you can disable this feature
and force the sampler to skip the assembly optimizations at runtime.
.TP
.IP \ --statistics
Output voice and disk stream count periodically on the console.
.TP
.IP \ --lscp-addr
Defines IP address on which the LSCP server should listen to (default: any).
.TP
.IP \ --lscp-port
Defines TCP port on which the LSCP server should listen to (default: 8888).

Version 0.3.3 (15 July 2005)

  Another bug fix release. It solves one usability issue regarding small
  fragments / high sampling rates of audio drivers, fixes some compile time
  errors with GCC 4.0 and fixes a minor efficiency bug.

Version 0.3.2 (24 June 2005)

  This is more or less just a bug fix release. Beside a bunch of little
  fixes it solves a serious crash in conjunction with voice stealing and
  slightly improves Gigasampler format playback accuracy.

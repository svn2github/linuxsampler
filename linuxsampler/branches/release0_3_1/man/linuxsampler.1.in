.SH DESCRIPTION
LinuxSampler is a modular, streaming capable sampler. The sampler is designed as
backend, that is server-like console application. You will need a frontend
application like QSampler to control the sampler and manage sampler sessions. Or
you have to send LSCP commands manually to the sampler e.g. by using telnet or
netcat.

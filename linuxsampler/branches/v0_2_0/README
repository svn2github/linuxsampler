LinuxSampler is in alpha phase and thus intended to be a DEVELOPERS VERSION
ONLY! A lot of functionality is not yet implemented or working correctly.
You may even have to adjust things to get it running on your system.

The compilation on OSX currently uses an XCode project. 

- Download and install the JackOSX package (www.jackosx.com)

- In the "osx" folder, possibly manually edit the version.h to change the version number

- In the XCode project, build the "LinuxSampler" target

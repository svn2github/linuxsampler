Benno Senoner <benno@gardena.net> originally wrote the proof-of-concept code
"Evo" and ported LinuxSampler to the Windows platform.

Christian Schoenebeck <cuse@users.sourceforge.net> was and is currently the
main author of LinuxSampler.

Vladimir Senkov <hangup@users.sourceforge.net> was the first one who
actively joined the development of this application. He was especially
involved in designing the network protocol "LSCP" and it's implementation on
LinuxSampler side and in developing the MMX/SSE(1) assembly optimizations.
Not to forget the huge list of bugs he fixed.

Steve Harris made the filter impulse response analysis of the Gigasampler
filters and developed the first version of the Gigasampler style filters.

Stéphane Letz <letz@grame.fr> was responsible for the initial OS X port and
fixed couple of bugs.

Rui Nuno Capela was also especially involved in the "LSCP" design and
implementation.

Andreas Persson made a lot of important fixes and improvents regarding the
Gigasampler format handling. Especially the Gigasmpler v3 format support was
developed by him. He also had his hands on a lot of quality improvements
and bug fixes and developed the base host plugin system and implemented
support for the sampler being used as VST, DSSI and LV2 plugin.

Grigor Iliev <grishata@users.sourceforge.net> added and implemented LSCP
commands for muting and solo-ing sampler channels, added sostenuto pedal
support, implemented the instruments database system and the Audio Unit
plugin version of the sampler for Mac and fixed a lot of bugs.

Toshi Nagata was responsible for the current OS X port and added autoconf
support to the XCode project file.

    "Gene" a.k.a Anders Alm

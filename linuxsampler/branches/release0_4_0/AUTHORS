Benno Senoner <benno@gardena.net> originally wrote the proof-of-concept code
"Evo". Maybe we can get him to contribute again one day. ;-)

Christian Schoenebeck <cuse@users.sourceforge.net> was and is currently the
main author of LinuxSampler.

Vladimir Senkov <hangup@users.sourceforge.net> was the first one who
actively joined the development of this application. He was especially
involved in designing the network protocol "LSCP" and it's implementation on
LinuxSampler side and in developing the MMX/SSE(1) assembly optimizations.
Not to forget the huge list of bugs he fixed.

Steve Harris made the filter impulse response analysis of the Gigasampler
filters and developed the first version of the Gigasampler style filters.

Stéphane Letz <letz@grame.fr> was responsible for the OS X port and fixed
couple of bugs.

Rui Nuno Capela was also especially involved in the "LSCP" design and
implementation.

Andreas Persson made a lot of important fixes and improvents regarding the
Gigasampler format handling. Especially the Gigasmpler v3 format support was
developed by him. He also had his hands on a lot of quality improvements
and bug fixes.

Grigor Iliev <grishata@users.sourceforge.net> added and implemented LSCP
commands for muting and solo-ing sampler channels, added sostenuto pedal
support and fixed a bunch of bugs regarding the LSCP server.

Smaller (but not necessarily minor) patches were received from the following
people:

    James Klicman
    "Gene" a.k.a Anders Alm
    Ebrahim Mayat
    Juan Linietsky

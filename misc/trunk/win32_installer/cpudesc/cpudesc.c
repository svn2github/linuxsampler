/* NSIS plug-in for getting a bit of CPU information.
		Version 1.2, July 2003.
		Typed and clicked by Peter Mason, CSIRO DEM MMTG.  mailto://peter.mason@csiro.au.
		The MHz timing was done using code that was pretty much copied from Pavlos Touboulidis' CPUTEST code.
		The lean exception handler wrapped around the timing code was done using Jeremy Gordon's tutorial on writing
		lightweight win32 exception handlers in assembler.   (His web-page is www.GoDevTool.com.)
		The CPUID stuff was done using Intel and AMD's manuals on what CPUID means in their respective microcosms.
		Best viewed with <TAB> == 2 spaces.

		There's only one routine here - tell() - and its output is a string on the NSIS stack.
		This string always has the same fields in exactly the same place.   (Easier to extract values that way.)   It looks like this:

			INTELP=d AMD=add PPRO=b MMX=d SSE=b SSE2=b 3DNOW=d ARCH=dd LEVEL=dd NCPU=dd MHZ=ddddd RAM=dddd

		Here, "d" means a decimal digit (0..9), "a" means an alphabetic character (A..Z) and "b" means a boolean digit (0 or 1).
		ITELP: Values range [0..4].
			0:		Not a genuine Intel CPU (or a very, VERY old one).
			1:		Pentium or Pentium with MMX.   (Check the MMX field if you want to know about the CPU's MMX support.)
			2:		Pentium Pro, II or Celeron.   (May or may not have MMX - PPros don't, the others do.   Check the MMX field.)
			3:		Pentium III or P3 (old) Xeon.   (Always has MMX and SSE.)
			4:		Pentium IV or (new) Xeon.   (Always has MMX, SSE and SSE2.)
		AMD: A bit more complicated...
			000:	Not an authentic AMD CPU (or a very old one).
			Kdd:	An old K-series.   "dd" is either 05 for a K5 or 06 for a K6.
						(Pentium compatible.   K5s have no MMX or 3DNOW.   K6s have standard MMX, and later models have basic 3DNOW.)
			Add:	An Athlon or a Duron.   "dd" is the model number (goes from 01 to 10).
						(Pentium II compatible.   All of these have extended MMX and extended 3DNOW.   None have any SSE.)
			Odd:	An opteron.   "dd" gives the model number.
						(Pentium IV compatible.   This CPU's got everything, it seems.)
		PPRO:		Values range [0..1].
		  0:    Not compatible with the Intel Pentium Pro processor.
		  1:    Compatible with the Intel Pentium Pro processor.
		MMX:		Values range [0..2].
			0:		No MMX support.
			1:		Standard Intel MMX support.
			2:		Standard MMX support plus AMD MMX extensions.
		SSE:		Values range [0..1].
			0:		No SSE support.
			1:		Supports SSE (Intel's Streaming SIMD extensions, P3-style).
		SSE2:		Values range [0..1].
			0:		No SSE2 support.
			1:		Supports SSE2 (Intel's Streaming SIMD extensions 2, P4-style).
		3DNOW:	Values range [0..2].
			0:		No 3DNOW support.
			1:		Standard AMD 3DNOW support.
			2:		Standard 3DNOW support plus AMD 3DNOW extensions.
		ARCH:		Values range [00..10].
			00:		32-bit Intel or compatible
			01:		MIPS (did NT 3.5, apparently)
			02:		DEC Alpha.   (Yes, DEC.   I can't bring myself to call it COMPAQ.)
			03:		PowerPC
			04:		SHX (?)
			05:		ARM (Acorn / Advanced Risc Machine, I presume.   I don't think anyone's going to see this running Windows?)
			06:		64-bit Intel.
			07:		64-bit Alpha
			08:		MSIL (?)
			09:   64-bit AMD
			10:		32-bit Intel doing Win64 (?)
		LEVEL:	"Processor level", like what you see in the main processor environment variable.   Sort-of useless, really.
		NCPU:		The number of processors available.   (Affected by that "Hyper" business that the new XEONs can do, I think.)
		MHZ:		The CPU's internal clock speed in MHz (approx).
		RAM:		The amount of RAM (physical memory) in megabytes (rounded).

/**************/
/*	Unfortunately, there's no decent way (in non-privileged mode) to tell if the CPU is allowed to execute the RDTSC
		instruction in non-privileged mode.   The relevant status bit is bit 2 in "CR4" (control register 4), and we can't
		even look at CR4 in user mode.
		So I have resorted to the indiscrete way of letting it f.. er, throw an exception if it must...
		In the event of an exception (due to disallowed use of RDTSC), the exception will get caught and the MHz value
		pulled out of the registry earlier will silently get returned instead of a timed value.   The exception handler
		is very simple-minded.   It doesn't check what sort of exception occurred, it just "handles" it by jumping to the
		end of the timer code.   (If it gets called, it's assumed that it was due to a disallowed call to RDTSC.)
		BTW, this code seems to produce a good answer on a dual CPU PC.
